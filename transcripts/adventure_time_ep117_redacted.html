<b>Marcy</b>:  You're so silly, Simon!

<b>Simon</b>:  He-he-he, yeah, I suppose so... Huh?

<b>Marcy</b>:  Simon! Simon, are you okay?!

<b>Simon</b>:  Uh...uh...yeah.

<b>Marcy</b>:  What are you talking about? You're scaring me.

<b>Simon</b>:  [<i>continues laughing. His hair and nose grow back to normal.</i>] I'm sorry. Did I say something?

<b>Marcy</b>:  Simon, promise me you won't put it on again.

<b>Simon</b>:  [<i>looks down</i>] OK. I promise.

<b>Marcy</b>:  What <i>is</i> that thing?

<b>Simon</b>:  It's a deer.

[<i>Simon and Marcy walk over to the frozen deer. The looks around and breathes heavily two times</i>]

<b>Marcy</b>:  If there are deers in the forest, do you think there are <i>other</i> things?

<b>Simon</b>:  [<i>eyes widen</i>] I don't know. [<i>cuts to Simon and Marcy roasting food</i>] Hm... [<i>whistles a tune. He sets a broken television upright</i>] Uhh! This is gonna be good.

<b>Marcy</b>:  [<i>steps on a remote</i>] Oops.

<b>Simon</b>:  Hey, little lady, what about a ride on an old man's back?

<b>Marcy</b>:  I can walk. I'm not a child, Simon.

<b>Simon</b>:  Look, sweetie, someday you'll be too big to hold. I'm as old as garlic balls, and if someone offered to pick me up and carry me, I'd do it in a heartbeat. Take it when you can get it. [<i>Carries Marcy then she sneezes on his face and laughs</i>]

<b>Simon</b>:  Gross. [<i>wipes it away</i>] You're gross.
