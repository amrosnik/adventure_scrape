<b>Ice King</b>:  Eeh? [<i>He nets the cat.</i>]

[<i>Another rabbit stops to scratch itself, it is also netted. A cat licks its paw, it is netted as well. Two rabbits hopping on a trampoline, they are netted and stop for a bit, only to hope again. Two cats purring as one messages the other's back, they are also netted. More rabbits, three of them, attempt to run from a flying Ice King who nets them all.</i>]

[<i>Back at the Ice Kingdom, the Ice King is holding a cat.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Places a lemon on the cat, the lemon promptly falls off.</i>]

<b>Cat</b>:  Meow?

<b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, quiet you. [<i>Places another lemon on the cat and this time it appears to stay balance, he then grabs a piece of yarn and secures the lemon.</i>] That's it for the kitties! [<i>Shoves cat into sack.</i>] [<i>Walks over to kitchen table.</i>] How are my bunnies doing?

[<i>The rabbits are eating a pan of lasagna.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Hee hee, that's it, ah yes. Gunter! More la<i>zag</i>nah!

<b>Gunter</b>:  Whenk. [<i>Pulls out fresh baked lasagna.</i>]

[<i>The Ice King walks to the edge of the snow behind a bush with two sacks over his shoulder. He places the bags down and peeps around the bush to see the partygoers still partying.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Okay! [<i>Opens sack that contains the cats.</i>] Go, my little sour pussies, ruin their party! Hee hee hee.

[<i>Slime Princess, Jake, Finn, and <a href="/wiki/Hot_Dog_Princess" title="Hot Dog Princess">Hot Dog Princess</a> are dancing. Finn is dancing on one foot.</i>]

[<i>Back to Ice King still behind the bush.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>He "tsks" and grumbles. He reaches for the second sack containing the rabbits.</i>] At least I still have my "party-poopers," heh heh, raagh! Oh glob [<i>Pants</i>] Urrreeh! [<i>Closes sack and wipes hand on his robe.</i>] So much la<i>zag</i>nah. [<i>Walks away leaving the sack in the snow.</i>]

[<i>Inside the castle, Ice King is taking out tape and a pair of socks.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Gunter, daddy needs you to dress up like a princess so you can sneak into that party and throw fruit punch on everybody.

<b>Gunter</b>:  Wenk.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Huh, you wanna do that for daddy, huh?

<b>Gunter</b>:  Wenk! [<i>Flaps flippers.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Thanks, sweetie! I can always count on my Gunts! [<i>Begins to rip off tape and stick socks on Gunter's body.</i>] [<i>Picks up bottle cap.</i>] Finishing touch.

<b>Gunter</b>:  Wenk. [<i>Drinks a little soda and goes in the middle of a ring.</i>] [<i>He starts dancing.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  No, Gunter! [<i>Starts crying.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmm, hey, Gunter, let me get one of them socks.

<b>Gunter</b>:  [<i>Pulls out taser and electrocutes Finn's arm which causes him to back away while screaming.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh... ow.

[<i>Ice King has stopped crying and is walking around.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  They think their party is the bee's knees huh. That party is the knees of nothing!

[<i>Ice King looks on his telescope, Gunter is still dancing and the partygoers are still chanting her name.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Bargh! There oughta be a law! Wait a minute... there is a law, hee hee, do I have what it takes?

[<i>Inside the <a href="/wiki/Banana_Guard" title="Banana Guard" class="mw-redirect">Banana Guard</a>'s surveillance room, the phone rings and one of the Banana Guards picks it up.</i>]

<b>Banana Guard</b>:  We'll take care of it.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Ha haa! [<i>Goes to window, pulls out opera glasses.</i>] Now to watch Banana law in action.

[<i>The Banana Guards show up and chat with Princess Bubblegum and then they start dancing.</i>] [<i>The Ice King's hand holding the glasses go limp.</i>]

<b>Banana Guard</b>:  This is a great party.

If only there was some way I could magically ruin their party. [<i>Looks at hands.</i>] Wait a minute [<i>Laughs</i>] forgetful me!

[<i>The Ice King flies to the sky and into a cloud, which turns dark and stormy. He shoots down a large ice lighting shard which hits a sound system and surprises Finn and the partygoers.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  I thought you were my bros, my roll dogs for life! [<i>Sends down hail which hits everyone and causes them discomfort. "Ow, Ice King!"</i>]

<b>Bounce House Princess</b>:  Ow! Hey, everyone, take refuge in my body! [<i>Everyone climbs inside her, except Finn who is sitting on the food table.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Oh mama, that's some stink! [<i>Loses altitude.</i>] Aaaah!

<b>Finn</b>:  Why are you doing this, IK?!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Because she didn't invite me to her potluck!
