<b>Cuber</b>:  Hmm? Oh! Hello there! Bayble navel! It’s great to see you! Here for more graybles, I reckon. Well, alright. Just like last time. [<i>Like in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Trek">Star Trek</a>, the window doubles as a digital screen</i>] We’ll watch five separate stories, each relating to one special theme.

[<i>laughs</i>] Now, look to my visualizer screen and let this exciting grayble dribble all over your mind-label! [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>Fade into first grayble</i>]

[<i>We first see that <a href="/wiki/Lady_Rainicorn" title="Lady Rainicorn">Lady</a> is outside <a href="/wiki/Lady_Rainicorn%27s_house" title="Lady Rainicorn's house">her house</a> reading and that <a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a> are in her loft.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake pushes aside the chicken and it flies away</i>] Okay, so- scooch! Okay so I’m still pretty sure this old book is some warlock spell book or something .

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Jake blows off the dust to reveal a nursery rhyme book</i>] Messed.

<b>Jake</b>:  Warlocks, dude! [<i>Jake sits down and opens the book</i>] You ready for some ancient feel good spell craft?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, I’ll try it. Could always stand to feel better.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake reads over the page, which is “Little Jack Horner”</i>] Leeeeet’s seeeee. You got your bibby?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Finn has a bib</i>] Check it! [<i>Jake stretches some of his skin to make a bib</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake uncovers the pie</i>] Yup! [<i>Finn and Jake hold up their thumbs and the background goes black. Jake begins reciting the rhyme as though it were a spell</i>]

Little Jack Horner

Sat in the corner, [<i>Finn peeks</i>]

Eating a Christmas pie;

He put in his thumb, [<i>They put in their thumbs and pull out plums</i>]

And pulled out a plum,

And said "What a good boy am I!"

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>They look around for something to happen</i>] I don’t feel like a good boy.

<b>Finn</b>:  You sure you read that spell right?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake is eating his plum</i>] Yeah. Still though. Pretty sweet.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wanna keep stickin’ our thumbs in stuff ‘til it works?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah! [<i>They high five with plums on their thumbs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [<i>Sticks his thumb in a bottle</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [<i>Finn is holding a chipmunk’ arms up and Jake sticks his thumb in its armpits</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Finn has his thumb in a mushroom and when he puts his thumb down, it breaks</i>] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-a— Do you feel like a good boy? [<i>Finn and Jake are sitting on rocks by a pond</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  No, I don’t.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey check out that gross toad! [<i>There is a toad with holes in its back with baby toads hoping in and out of them</i>]

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  [<i>They walk over to it and start poking the holes with their thumbs</i>] Oh-what-a-good-boy-am-I. Good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy.

<b>Toad</b>:  [<i>Finn and Jake talk over him</i>] Gross! Ahahah! Cut it out! Quit stickin’ your thumbs in my back! Ahhhh! [<i><a href="/wiki/Marceline" title="Marceline">Marceline</a> is hovering several feet above them, watching.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  Yeeeaaah, I don’t know. [<i>She pulls out her map and flies forward</i>] Uhhhhh, jeez! I’m never gonna find this place! Hmmm. [<i>There is a rock giant playing drums up ahead, but instead of drum sticks, he uses his massive fingers. Marceline flies towards him</i>] Hey! [<i>He ignores her and continues playing</i>] Hey! Hey rock giant! [<i>He stops to listen</i>] You seem cool! Do you know where <a href="/wiki/Wizard_Bill" title="Wizard Bill">wizard Bill</a>’s music shop is? I can’t find it anywhere!

<b>Wizard Bill</b>:  [<i>The giants finger bursts through Wizard Bill’s shop door and Bill is startled</i>] Whaglgalgaw!

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>The giant pulls back his finger, but Marceline couldn’t see through the cloud cover.</i>] Huuuuh. I’ve got an idea. [<i>Marceline sits on his finger</i>] Okaaay, point now. [<i>She is blowing in the wind and yelling cheerfully</i>] Wahahahoh yeah! Woowhohaha! [<i>She gets off and fist bumps him</i>] Thanks man! [<i>She enters the shop and Wizard Bill hands her the guitar and she plays it</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>:  [<i>She is wiping away tears</i>] Yes thank you. I-I heard a man calling out to me “Oh Tree Trunks!” So I said who’s calling? I don’t know. So I looked and he was making a RUDE gesture. [<i>Sounding as angry as a pie-making old lady can</i>] It left a sour taste in my mouth!

<b>Banana Guard</b>:  Alright, ma'am. [<i>He pulls out a pen and paper</i>] Let’s see. How do you spell your name?

<b>Football</b>:  [<i>BMO is talking to his reflection in the window</i>] But I don’t understand BMO. I’m a real baby girl now. I can smell the reddest lilacs. I can hear the screaming squirrels! Screaming for nuts! Oh my gosh! I can’t believe it’s true!

<b>BMO</b>:  No, Football. That’s not enough. You have to learn manners too. Otherwise, you’ll be all alone!

<b>Football</b>:  Alone? But-but what about you BMO?

<b>BMO</b>:  I will not always be here to protect you Football. No, you must learn. Here look! [<i>Pulls out grapefruit spoon</i>] This is a grapefruit spoon. It is only for eating grapefruit. [<i>Pulls out a salt shaker and shakes salt into the air</i>] This is a salt shaker. Here, you try. [<i>BMO and his reflection are both shaking the salt up into the air and laughing</i>] [<i>BMO pulls out a strange contraption</i>] Now this is a turnip grincher. [<i>Football looks at it quizzically</i>] For grinching. Aaand, this is how you drink tea. [<i>BMO sticks out his pinky and sips the tea</i>] Ahhh. [<i>The tea pours over his face</i>]

<b>BMO</b>:  [<i>Finn sighs. Finn and Jake walk up the ladder to find BMO, all charred, sitting on the couch</i>] Why so glum fellas?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Sounding depressed</i>] We stuck or thumbs in almost every hole today.

<b>Jake</b>:  But we never felt like good boys.

<b>BMO</b>:  I know a thing or two about good boys. Why don’t you try sticking your thumbs in these holes? [<i>BMO is holding his fingers to form a hole over the controllers’ start buttons</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>He looks at BMO’s fingers</i>] Controllers? [<i>He looks up to find a video game start screen called “<a href="/wiki/Super_Good_Boys" title="Super Good Boys">Super Good Boys</a>”</i>] Haha! Oh yeah! Super Good Boys!

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  [<i>They use their thumbs to push the buttons through BMO’s fingers</i>] Bawmp! [<i>The characters in the game start picking up trash and cleaning the digital house while BMO giggles</i>]

<b>Cuber</b>:  So, did you guess the theme? Go ahead and pause your viewer now if you need a few more glayble to think about it a little. [<i>A “pause viewer now” card appears for a second</i>] Oho! Now you’ve got it! I can tell! That’s right, the theme is the five tastes. [<i>For each example, a still from the corresponding grayble appears</i>] You see, Jake ate a SWEET plum. Marceline played some SAVORY licks. Tree Trunks had a SOUR taste inside her mouth. Oh my. Gunter wanted to drink the SALTY tears. And Football's tea was BITTER. [<i>He laughs until he supposedly hears something</i>] Huh? What’s that you say? You thought the theme was the five fingers? [<i>he laughs</i>] Don’t be silly! No one’s had five fingers for twenty blablillion glaybles. Five telepathy glands maybe. [<i>he calms down</i>] Ah… slimmin’. Well anyway, looks like it’s that time again. [<i>waves goodbye</i>] I’ll see you crimpy glimmers on triode flimpin’ the diode! [<i>he laughs as the screen cuts</i>]
