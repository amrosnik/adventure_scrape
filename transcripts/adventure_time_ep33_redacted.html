<b>Jake</b>: Oo, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough Guy contest! [<i>flexes bicep</i>] Whoo-hoo! [<i>Does a spin and poses</i>] Tough Boys!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Stares at crystal's side</i>] Wait man, doesn't this look like <a href="/wiki/Tree_Trunks_(character)" title="Tree Trunks (character)">Tree Trunks</a>' lipstick?

[<i>Jake visualizes the scenario of Tree Trunks's explosion.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: That's impossible, Tree Trunks exploded in the scary dark forest after she ate that <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Gem_Apple" title="Crystal Gem Apple">Crystal Gem Apple</a>, remember?

<b>Jake</b>: Hee-yah!

[<i>Cue screen [Finn's voice] "Round Two, baby!"</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Holding out his arm</i>] Do it, Finn, do it! [<i>clenches fist.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Pinches the skin on Jake's extended arm.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>His face wrinkles up trying to hold back a single tear. The tear is sucked back into his eye and Jake rubs his arm.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Quickly grabs for Finn's chest and twist.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>He begins to shriek but stops himself by biting his lip.</i>] [<i>A single tear tickles out of his eye and splashes onto the floor.] Noooooo!</i>

[<i>Cue screen [Jake's voice] "Round Three"</i>]

[<i>Both Finn &amp; Jake lock hands, trying to best the other. Finn puts Jake in a headlock.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Turned on his back he begins to cough.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Weakly</i>] I... was just... messing with... you [<i>poking Jake's forehead.</i>] [<i>He stands up and staggers to the tree's ladder.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Still concerned</i>] Are you okay?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Weakly and holding his stomach</i>] Yeah, [<i>breaths in</i>] I'm just going to rest my muscles. [<i>He climbs the ladder.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Oh dangit, Jake [<i>kicks a pink object</i>] you can't get all out of control like that! [<i>grabs a cup of juice</i>] Why am I like this?! [<i>echoing of last words</i>] like this... like this...

[<i>Flash back to Jake and his brother Jermaine in the forest, both have boxes gloves. Jermaine is face down in the grass while Jake cries over him.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Joshua" title="Joshua">Joshua</a></b>: [<i>Walks up to them</i>] Jake, what did you do to your brother?

<b>Jake</b>: We were just playin' and then I got out of control! I'm sorry, dad.

<b>Joshua</b>: [<i>Pats Jake's head</i>] No, son, you did good. [<i>points at him</i>] Having no self control makes you a tough galoot, like me!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Teary eyed</i>] But I don't want to hurt nobody!

<b>Joshua</b>: Well, that's too bad, kid, 'cause you're going to hurt everybody!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Covering his ears and wails</i>] Noooo!

[<i>Close up of window as the sun goes down and night comes.</i>] [<i>Shot of Tree Fort's exteriors as a bird's crowing is heard and the sun comes up.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Sitting on the floor sipping coffee</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Arrives in the kitchen and yawns</i>] 'Sup, dude?

<b>Jake</b>: Finn, you're okay! I was afraid I mashed your potatoes too hard last night.

<b>Finn</b>: Ha, you didn't mash my potatoes! [<i>quietly</i>] You didn't even make me cry silently into my pillow last night for- thirty minutes. In fact, you read to go again tough stuff?!

<b>Jake</b>: Nope, no more, dude.

<b>Finn</b>: What?!

<b>Jake</b>: I never wanna lose control again, man! I'm going totally soft [<i>body becomes blob like.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: You look like a wuss!

<b>Jake</b>: Mmm hmm.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Laughs</i>] [<i>Notices the crystal on the table.</i>] Hey, the crystal is glowing a different color! [<i>Picking it up and turning it, it begins to glow brighter causing Finn to drop it</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Whoa...

[<i>There is an explosion of bright light and Finn is knocked to the floor. Suddenly a portal appears and three <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Guardian" title="Crystal Guardian">Crystal Guardians</a> step through.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Chip-chap-chop, what's going on?!

<b>Crystal Guardian #1</b>: Uh, which one of you is Finn the Human?

<b>Finn</b>: Jake! [<i>being taken away.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Finn! [<i>runs to the portal and jumps through.</i>]

[<i>Jake lands face down in the Crystal Dimension. He quickly recovers to see Finn in a large bubble like prison, guarded by a single Guardian</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hey!

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, man, what happened?

<b>Finn</b>: I don't know, but I'm trapped in this crystal ball, get me out of here!

<b>Jake</b>: Okay, I'll try to do it using 'controlled conversation' [<i>rolls over to prison's door way.</i>]

<b>Crystal Guardian #3?</b>: Halt.

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, man, I'm Jake.

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: Beat it!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Purses lips</i>] I wanna know why you took my buddy and I'm not going to use force to get it out of you.

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: I'm just following orders, bub.

<b>Jake</b>: Whose orders?

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: Um, well, it's a secret but part of it is we're turning Finn into a crystal.

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, you can stop these guys now! [<i>Two guardians appear and zap the crystal ball</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Ah, man!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Pounding on the prison</i>] get me out of here!

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: No, you'll look awesome in crystal, like us!

<b>Jake</b>: Can't we work this out like gents?

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: Get lost! [<i>Kicks Jake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Smashes into a crystal and gets a vision with his father speaking to him.</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: Jake, lose control, flip out on those guys!

<b>Jake</b>: No, dad, I gotta control myself! [<i>His body morphs thin and long as he slithers back over to the doorway</i>] Control, control, control, con-trol.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Still surrounded by the two guardians, he is zapped again</i>] Help! My arm! [<i>His arm changes into crystal.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Whoa, okay okay. I'm hatching a controlled plan. Alright, man, move out of the way and let me get my friend.

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: Nope, not doing it.

<b>Jake</b>: Then I'll have to move you myself, [<i>zoom in of his mouth</i>] with my mind. [<i>Putting his hands to his head he concentrates intensely.</i>]

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: You're going to hurt yourself. Stop it.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>His face gradually reddens.</i>] [<i>He stops once a fart is let out and breaths heavily.</i>]

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: You're time is running out little dog. Hey, speed it up in there, guys.

<b>Crystal Guardian #1</b>: Okay, turn up the juice, man.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Screaming</i>] JAKE, HELP!

<b>Jake</b>: Finn! [<i>pumps up</i>] Don't hurt my buddy! [<i>gasps</i>] No, Jake, no, don't lose control.

<b>Joshua</b>: [<i>Appears to Jake again as a vision</i>] Jake, Jake, come on punch them, Jake, punch everybody. Why not? Come on! Why not?!

<b>Jake</b>: No, no punchies! I am in control! [<i>covers his face and cries.</i>]

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: Who are you talking to?

<b>Jake</b>: Nobody, man, don't look at me! [<i>runs away crying.</i>]

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: Whoa, [<i>chuckling</i>] did you guys see that?

<b>Crystal Guardians</b>: [Chuckling] Yeah. Yes

<b>Finn</b>: Don't make fun of him, he's having problems, everybody has- [<i>he is zapped again.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Punches a crystal and puts his head against it</i>] Stupid-ghost-dad! I'll show him! [<i>calmly</i>] Okay, intimidate them with controlled attack.

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: Hurry up, guys, I gotta drop a crystal donk.

<b>Crystal Guardian #2</b>: Oh, come on, I don't wanna hear that.

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: Hey, whatever man, I ain't ashamed- whoa, what the?! [<i>A shadow looms over him.</i>]

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: Stop it!

[<i>Cue screen "4 minutes later."</i>] [<i>Jake is still lightly punching the guardian.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: I'm not hurting you am I?

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: No, [<i>slapping hand away</i>] you freak!

<b>Jake</b>: Well, there's a lot more where that came from! So you best tell me why you're turning Finn into a crystal.

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: Or what, you'll touch me?

<b>Jake</b>: So, help me I will touch you!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Screaming</i>] JAKE! AHH! HELP!!

<b>Jake</b>: Finn, oh no!

<b>Crystal Guardian #3</b>: [<i>Pushing Jake back</i>] cut it out he looks good.

<b>Finn</b>: MY BODY!! [<i>he turns completely crystal.</i>] [<i>The prison pops and he falls to the ground.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Nooo! My bud!! [<i>shrinks down.</i>]

<b>Crystal Guardian #2</b>: Ah, let him in, he can't do nothing now.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Runs over the crystallized Finn</i>] I'm sorry, Finn, I'm super lame and now...you're dead.

<b>Finn</b>: I'm not dead, I'm just all crystal stiff.

<b>Jake</b>: Oh.

<b>A voice</b>: Get your hands off My lover!

<b>Jake</b>: That voice.

<b>Finn</b>: It sounds like-

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>She appears from a corridor, hovering, pale skinned and crystal-eyed.</i>] Yes, Finn, it's me, Tree Trunks. [<i>Jake dragging Finn away</i>] but in this world I am known as Quartzion the Crystal Queen.

<b>Finn</b>: Oh my grosh, you're alive!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, I'm more than alive, Finn. After I ate that Crystal Apple in the scary dark forest, I was transported to this crystal dimension where I become ruler of the crystal men. And the crystal men are all in love with me.

[All three Crystal Guardians run up to Tree Trunks to profess their love.]

<b>Crystal Guardians</b>: Love you Quartzion! Quartzion, I love you! Quartzion, we love you! [<i>bows.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Yes, yes I know, but you love... is not enough [<i>grins evilly</i>] [<i>Her eyes glow and from her trunk, a beam zaps the guardians into dust, Finn and Jake gasp.</i>] I wanted you, Finn, so you could be transformed into my sexy crystal king.

<b>Finn</b>: Tree Trunks, you've gone bananas with crystal power!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Finn, it's not sexy for a king to call his queen bananas! [<i>she unleashes a beam of light that turns the surroundings into dust, but Jake grabs Finn and runs for cover.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, you totally gotta stop her!

<b>Jake</b>: I'll try man, but I'm still figuring out my bizz, [<i>stretches his legs to reach her height</i>] here I come, Tree Trunks! [<i>lightly touches her trunk</i>] Taste my gentle rubs!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Whoa there, don't you put your junk on my trunk! [<i>wraps Jake up.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Go, Jake, go!

<b>Jake</b>: She's too sassy and powerful! [<i>gets thrown at a crystal.</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: [<i>His disembodied voice is heard</i>] Jake, Jake, I brought someone here to see you, it's your brother.

<b>Jake</b>: Jermaine?! Are you dead?

<b><a href="/wiki/Jermaine" title="Jermaine" class="mw-redirect">Jermaine</a></b>: Nah man, we're just dreamin' at the same time.

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, I'm sorry about that time I beat you up.

<b>Jermaine</b>: That was an accident, I knew you were just horsin' off!

<b>Jake</b>: But dad, you said I was going to hurt everybody!

<b>Joshua</b>: Yeah, every-bod-y.

<b>Jake</b>: I don't know, dad, that doesn't really help me.

<b>Joshua</b>: Everybody who is <i>evil</i>, Jake. Let me finish next time, hm, yeah?

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, well then I'm over it then! Rarr [<i>charges back into battle.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, kick Tree Trunks in the tummy, shes probably still got that crystal gem inside her!

<b>Jake</b>: That must be giving her all her powers!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Marry me, Finn, we can snuggle through time and space and kiss each other in an alternate dimensional place.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Morphs his foot into a giant boot and kicks Tree Trunks in the stomach.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>Coughs up the Crystal Apple and returns to normal. The apple bounces off a wall, lands and opens a portal.</i>] Oh, dear.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Busts out of his crystal body and cheers.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: TT, you're back.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, Jake, I was behaving so inappropriately I'm so embarrassed.

<b>Jake</b>: Oh shush, Tree Trunks, if I had a penny for every time someone went crazy hopped up on magic energy... I'd be Abraham Lincoln!

<b>Finn</b>: Tree Trunks, you're okay!

<b>Jake &amp; Tree Trunks</b>: Finn!

<b>Finn</b>: I'm okay toooo! [<i>does a cartwheel.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, Finn, I was trapped here for so long and all I could think about was you and how your so nice to me and I, and I just wanted to say... I think... you're cute and I like you.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Blushing</i>] Okay, okay, let's go.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Finn, when we get home, it's <i>apple pie time</i>.

<b>Finn</b>: Ooooh!! [<i>picks her up and jumps through the portal, she giggles.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: ♪<a href="/wiki/Apple_Pie" title="Apple Pie">Apple pie</a> in the oven, Tell me you can taste lovin'♪
