<b>Finn</b>: Oh, geez. Oh, geez. Ugh, come on. Uh... Come on. Come on.

<b><a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Bubblegum</a></b>: Finn, don't worry about it. We've got bigger fish to fry right now.

[<i>The cloud monster roars and sucks up some cows and <a href="/wiki/Fat_Villagers" title="Fat Villagers">villagers</a> into its body.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: But...

<b>Bubblegum</b>: It's fine. Pep-but used to love being scattered all around. He used to tell me that.

<b>Peppermint Butler's mouth</b>: Lies!

<b>Bubblegum</b>: [<i>turns on levitating couch</i>] Those farmers won't keep this thing busy for long. [<i>climbs on couch</i>] So it's up to the four of us to stop him. Are you ready, Marceline? Marceline? Hey, what's wrong?

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Me, I guess.

<b>Bubblegum</b>: What?

<b>Marceline</b>: Me. I'm wrong. This—all of this—this is all my fault. Even just fighting the vampires in the first place screwed everything up. Sure screwed <i>me</i> up, anyway. And, geez Louise, trying to fix it—trying to fix me... Just made things a thousand times worse. So why even try, you know? What's the point?

<b>Bubblegum</b>: What? Marceline, no. Come on! We're always the underdogs, you and me, and we always pull through. Like that one time, you remember? The case of the purloined egg?

<b>Marceline</b>: No! I told you, that's it. I'm done.

[<i>Scene changes to a villager rallying the other farmers.</i>]

<b>Cloud Dance</b>: All right people, this is our last stand! It's gonna take every one of us to see this thing through—me, Onion Man, Short Man, Terry—[<i>Bubblegum flies overhead</i>] whoa!—Short-Stack, Good-Beard, DeShawn, Seedman, Sandwich Paul, Angry Susan...

[<i>Bubblegum cuts the side of the cloud with a hatchet.</i>]

<b>Cloud Dance</b>: Muy Linda, Dr. Belstar...

<b>Farmer</b>: [<i>inside cloud</i>] Help!

<b>Cloud Dance</b>: ...Limbo Man, Quasar, Dogman, Tightwad, Raspberry Sam...

[<i>Bubblegum pulls a villager from out of the cloud.</i>]

<b>Farmer #2</b>: Up here!

<b>Cloud Dance</b>: ...DJ Fresh-Start, and my boy Big Trace.

[<i>Back at the ruins of the cabin.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: You sure you're not coming, Marceline? We could really use your help. Marceline? Okay, maybe later then.

<b><a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></b>: Come on, Finn! Let me hear that war cry!

[<i>The two belch, and Jake stretches up to the cloud.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>looking up at cloud monster</i>] Well, you finally did it, big guy. You won. Well played. I just kind of wish you would gotten it over with a thousand years ago and saved us all some trouble.

[<i>The cloud monster walks over her, dousing her with rain as it passes.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Better late than never, I guess. [<i>sighs</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: You remembered my song! [<i>chuckles</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Simon? W-what are you doing here?

<b>Ice King</b>: Well, I saw through my peeping scope that everything was going boom and exploding and monsters, and all my friends were in grave danger and horrible torment.

<b>Marceline</b>: And you wanted to help?

<b>Ice King</b>: No! I felt left out. I'm just a phone call away, you know.

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>hugs him</i>] I'm sorry, Simon. Next time, for sure. [<i>sighs</i>] Anyway, you don't want in on this fight. This one's a loser.

<b>Ice King</b>: Oh, I see. Sittin' this one out, huh?

<b>Marceline</b>: Yeah, I guess. And don't try to talk me out of it.

<b>Ice King</b>: What? No, no, I'm right there with you. You and me—we're survivors, right? Like cockroaches or rats. Sure, you could fight and try to save the day, but what if you lose? Then what? You could die. Better to rot and hide like a rat, right, buddy? [<i>hugs Marceline</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Ugh! [<i>pushes Ice King away</i>] Did you just call me a cockroach, Simon?!

<b>Ice King</b>: What? No! No, no, no, no.

<b>Marceline</b>: Thanks, buddy.

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Yeesh, it does sound bad! Hey, banana men, listen to your princess! In my kingdom, we look after our own—me! You look after me! Close the gates!

[<i>The Candy People cheer and run toward the cloud monster. Bubblegum slashes its cheek. Finn slashes at its side but almost falls off of Jake.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa!

<b>Jake</b>: Finn, this ain't workin'. It's just fart grabbin'.

[<i>Marceline flies straight up into the cloud monster.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: King? Vampire king? You still in here? Hello? Too bad.

[<i>Marceline's body glows. A mouth opens on her heart.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Oh, boy! Ooh, I am famished!

[<i>The mouth sucks the air like a vacuum, causing the monster to slowly implode.</i>]

[<i>They cheer and attack the monster's leg. As Marceline continues to suck up the cloud monster, the animals it sucked up fall out.</i>]

<b>Cow</b>: Whoa-ho-ho. Whoa!

[<i>The cloud monster gets smaller and smaller until only its head remains. Just before it disappears into Marceline's heart-mouth, it bites Marceline's neck.</i>]

<b>Bubblegum</b>: Marceline?

<b>Finn</b>: Marceline?

<b>Marceline</b>: Sorry, what?

<b>Finn</b>: I was just saying we stocked your fridge with lipstick and stuff, so you'll have lots to eat.

<b>Marceline</b>: Aww, thanks, dude.

<b>Jake</b>: Also, we got you crosswords, "sudukus," and connect-the-dots. Just take her easy, buddy.

<b>Marceline</b>: Sure.

<b>Bubblegum</b>: Oh, hey, I was thinking—so, once I usurp Crunchy, I'll have my castle back again, and there's plenty of room there if you don't want to be alone.

<b>Marceline</b>: No, I think I need to ruminate a little—think about being a vampire again.

<b>Finn</b>: Are you, uh... Do you feel bad? I don't want to say, like, "I'm sorry about who you are" or anything if you're feeling okay, but I don't know how bad news all of this is... Right?

<b>Marceline</b>: Nah, I'm cool being a vampire again. Being mortal was good... At the same time, it was terrifying. Now I'm a vampire with fresh mortal memories and—I don't know—more empathy or something... More grown-up. Bonnie, thank you for helping me grow up. Now, I guess we get to hang out together forever.
