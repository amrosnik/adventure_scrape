[<i>Gumbald reverts back to the Punch Bowl again, laughing stupidly and running away.</i>]

<b>Lolly</b>: He never was the epiphany type. But I am willing to let bygones be bygones.

<b>Simon Petrikov</b>: Look, Betty. I keep seeing reference to this mysterious entity that embodies chaos.

<b>Betty Grof</b>: That's great! Come on, let's make sundaes.

<b>Simon</b>: GOLB would say ice cream is without meaning. Just empty calories devoid of purpose.

<b>Betty</b>: Good thing he isn't here then.

<b>Simon</b>: [<i>Pours chocolate syrup on his sundae</i>] His presence is felt in every crevice where chaos lurks. Imagine if we could somehow harness all that dank energy...!

<b>Betty</b>: Hey! You want some cherries with that chocolate syrup?

<b>Simon</b>: [<i>Now there is too much chocolate syrup on the sundae</i>] Oh! [<i>Chuckles</i>] Sure.

<b>Ice King</b>: What's up?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Finn and Jake join them.</i>] Ho-ho-ho.

<b>Finn</b>: How do I stop this! [<i>Shoved away by King Man</i>] What?

<b>King Man</b>: You are the only one who can stop this! Betty's up there, trying to harness the power of GOLB! We have to snap her out of that trance and banish GOLB, or we're all doomed! If anyone can do it, it's you.
