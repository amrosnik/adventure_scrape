<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Don't ever mess with me again!

[<i>Flame Princess shoots out the window in a trail of fire.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Looks at <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></i>] Who <i>was</i> that?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Still terrified</i>] The Princess of the <a href="/wiki/Fire_Kingdom" title="Fire Kingdom">Fire Kingdom</a>?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Looks out the window, then back at Jake</i>] Dude, I think I have a crush.

[<i>Finn walks in front of Jake.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What do you know about her, Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  I was trying to help you get over your <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a> sad times by hooking you two up. But she's evil, man!

<b>Finn</b>:  You shut your dirty mouth! [<i>Slaps Jake. Finn's angry outburst causes the burn mark to disappear</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Dirty? [<i>Checks gums</i>] Oh. No, really man! Her <a href="/wiki/Flame_King" title="Flame King">dad</a> said she was evil!

<b>Finn</b>:  Naw, man, I peeped beyond her burning gaze, and noshed hot lunch with her soul. [<i>Walks to the window</i>] She ain't evil. She's passionate. Help me track her down.

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmmm..

<b>Finn</b>:  C'mon, man, I really like her. Help me out. [<i>Rubs Jake's face</i>] Jake, Jake help me out. Help me out. Jake, Jake, help me. Jake, Jake, help me!

<b>Jake</b>:  Eeeeeeeeehhh, ok.

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoo! Alright!

[<i>The scene cut to Jake walking over trees as a giant with Finn on his head.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  You sure you're not into any other princesses? What about <a href="/wiki/Wildberry_Princess" title="Wildberry Princess">Wildberry Princess</a>? She's small and plump. You could sleep on her like a pillow. Could be nice.

[<i>Light shines on Finn and Jake as a burning bird flies away.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Is that bird... smoking?

<b>Brown Bird</b>:  Hey, don't you judge me. It was that fire chick down there that done this to me.

[<i>Jake stretches down the bushes as he and Finn hide behind them. They see Flame Princess touching flowers and burning them</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Oh.

[<i>The fire burns other flowers, spreading towards a lake.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, Jake... look at her. She's innocent. Like the steam off a puppy's nose, searching for ham in the snow.

<b>Jake</b>:  Guy drops one piece of ham in the snow and he never hears the end of it! Snap out of it! She's burning cute little flowers!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Focusing on Flame Princess</i>] Yeah, she <i>is</i> like a cute little flower.

[<i>Flame Princess walks towards the lake, kneels and dips her hand in it</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Aaahh!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Comes out of the bush</i>] Oh, no, are you ok?

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I... I was just worried about you.

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Huh?

<b>Finn</b>:  Look, I'm sorry about what I said before. I don't know what happened, but I just, I had to see you again. And, I don't know.. I don't know anything about you, [<i>Flame Princess glows brighter</i>] but I just, I really like you. You know, you're so... beautiful.

[<i>Flame Princess glows brightly</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Sees fire beneath him</i>] Whoa!

[<i>Finn stomps on fire, but stops when he sees Flame Princess reacting with pain.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Ah!

[<i>Finn stomps on fire again</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Ow!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, Glob. Am I hurting you?

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Yes! That's all you've done! [<i>gasps</i>] Are you <i>trying</i> to hurt me?! Is that why you're <i>following</i> me?!

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm not followi-- Well, I guess technically I <i>am</i> following you.

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Gasps then runs away</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, no wait! [<i>Chases Flame Princess</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughs awkwardly</i>] I guess now I'm technically chasing you. [<i>Laughs again</i>]

[<i>Jake comes out of the bushes</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn!

[<i>Flame Princess burns tree. Tree falls down, blocking Finn and Jake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hold on! [<i>Turns into a giant and uses his "buns" to put out the fire on the tree</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Eaoww.. Toasty buns. [<i>Runs off while carrying Finn as they reach the end of the forest</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Where are you? I want to chat it up with you! Oh, we lost her!

[<i>Flame Princess appears as trails of fire then reforms</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa.

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  I am ambushing you! [<i>Throws fireball</i>]

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  Aah!

[<i>Finn and Jake run around to avoid fireballs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, I like your fireballs.

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Huh? Why do you torment me?

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm not trying to. I just like you. I think I... I think I <i>like-like</i> you. Listen, when I look at you, my brain goes all stupid. And I just wanna hug you, and sit on the couch and play <a href="/wiki/BMO" title="BMO">BMO</a> with you. I can't explain why, but, I never felt this way before and I think we should be together.

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  I... [<i>Smiles, blushes and glows brightly</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Smiles, claps, and laughs in excitement</i>] Yeah.

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Rggh! Enough. You should not toy with the emotions of a fire elemental.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait wait, I really didn't--

<b>Flame Princess</b>: You told me you liked me, and you made my flame grow brighter, but then you put me out, which hurt! [<i>Throws a big fireball at Finn and Jake</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  You're trying to impede me. <i>That</i> must be your purpose, ...but fire's purpose is to burn, so I'm going to turn this land into <i>my</i> fire kingdom!

<b>Finn</b>:  No!

[<i>Flame Princess creates a fire wall as Finn and Jake back away from the fire</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  She's headed for <a href="/wiki/Goblin_Kingdom" title="Goblin Kingdom">Goblin Kingdom</a>! We need to defeat this fiery she-beast!

<b>Finn</b>:  I can't fight her, man. I'm still into her!

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn, what's more important? Your love for that screwball dame, or being a hero and savin' the lives of innocent goblin folks?

<b>Finn</b>:  Rrrrhh.. Being a hero.

<b>Jake</b>:  Alright, c'mon! Let's go build fire-proof suits.

[<i>Scene cuts to the Tree Fort's garage.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Frantically searching pile of junk</i>] Uh-uh-uh, I gotta' get back to her.

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude, slow down or your fire suit will be junk. [<i>Sees a bag of bread</i>] Ooh. Is bags of old bread fire-proof? [<i>Slightly shoves the bag, showing <a href="/wiki/Neptr" title="Neptr">Neptr</a>.</i>]

<b>Neptr</b>:  Jake, you've found Neptr! I am the ultimate hide-and-seek champion! 15 months, 4 days, 9 hours and you guys did not find me! [<i>Spins his oven body</i>] Hahahaha-hahaha.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Whispers to Finn</i>] Oh, plops, we forgot about the game.

<b>Finn</b>:  Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...

<b>Neptr</b>:  I missed you, creator.

<b>Finn</b>:  And we missed you, too, but Neptr, right now we need you to--

<b>Neptr</b>:  To count to 100 while <i>you</i> hide? 1, 2,.. 3, 4, 5--

[<i>Finn halts Neptr</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Neptr, will you help us build fire-proof suits?

[<i>Neptr raises his arm</i>]

<b>Neptr</b>:  You cannot tell but I am giving a thumbs up.

[<i>Neptr raps "<a href="/wiki/Working_for_the_Master" title="Working for the Master">Working for the Master</a>" as he builds Finn and Jake fire-proof suits while the two assist him</i>]

<b>Neptr</b>:  I am finished!

[<i>The scene cuts to Finn flying with his suit.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I sure hope Flame Princess is okay.

<b>Neptr</b>:  Haha, we are as one, creator.

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, you think Flame Princess is okay?

[<i>Jake rises up as Finn spins to avoid Jake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  DUUUUDE! I feel like I can touch the heavens! [<i>Whispers</i>] And sock angels!

<b>Finn</b>:  We're coming up on the Goblin Kingdom.

[<i>Finn and Jake fly above trails of fire as they see the kingdom</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  There she is.

[<i>Flame Princess shoots fire on houses</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  She seems okay.

<b>Goblin</b>:  AAAAHH! Wood for sale! Wood on fire for sale!

[<i>Flame Princess shoots out two lines of fire and turns around</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  It's really starting to come together. Needs more... fire... hmm.

<b>Finn</b>:  Flame Princess!

[<i>Flame Princess turns</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Listen, you gotta stop burning the Goblin Kingdom, ...but I don't wanna fight you or hurt you, I swear.

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  I've heard this all before. [<i>Shoots fireballs at Finn and Jake but their suits put out the fireballs. They land in front of Flame Princess</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  You... MEANIE! [<i>Throws fireball at Finn. The suit deflects the fireball as the latter bounces. Hitting a goblin's cart.</i>]

<b>Goblin</b>:  My cart. I was born in that cart!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Gasp</i>] I'll put it out! [<i>Jake runs through cart and crashes into a building.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Ah!

<b>Finn</b>:  Aah! Jake didn't mean that!

[<i>Flame Princess shoots a stream of fire at a building.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh... [<i>Hovers near the fire.</i>] I need your help Finn! This one's too big! [<i>Kicks fire</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Ah! Whyyyy?!

<b>Finn</b>:  No, Jake, stop. You're hurting her!

<b>Neptr</b>:  I will solve this, creator. I will extinguish her using our suit! Foam blaster. [<i>Neptr raises the suits right arm and retracts the hand into a blaster.</i>] Hold still, burning lady.

[<i>Neptr turns the suit around and aims the blaster at Flame Princess</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Wha?

<b>Neptr</b>:  Locked on target.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Finn holds the blaster with his suit's left hand</i>] No, Neptr!

<b>Neptr</b>:  Yes, creator.

[<i>Finn turns the suit around, before the blaster fires</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  NOOOO!

[<i>The blaster hits Flame Princess's fire</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  AH!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Distressed</i>] I'm sorry!

[<i>Neptr lowers the right arm down, hitting Jake with foam as his suit is covered by it.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  That is the last time you hurt me. [<i>Transforms into her giant form</i>] RAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!

<b>Finn</b>:  My bad, Jake! Turn it off, Neptr!

[<i>Finn turns to look at Flame Princess</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gasp</i>]

<b>Neptr</b>:  Oh, my...

[<i>Flame Princess turns around and burns the whole city.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  NO!

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  RAAAAAAAAAHH! [<i>A "tear" comes out from Flame Princess's right eye.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  No more... No more! [<i>Kneels the suit then rips out of his suit and climbs at its top.</i>] FLAME PRINCESS!

[<i>Flame Princess walks away</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I can't fight her, ...but I can't let her destroy the city... <i>I've failed everyone</i>.

[<i>Neptr turns</i>]

<b>Neptr</b>:  Not true, creator. You haven't failed Neptr. Even if everyone burns, you'll still have me, creator.

[<i>Finn looks at Jake, who is moving his own suit's limbs. Jake takes a scoop of the foam and eats it.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Mmm! [<i>Smiles and gets another scoop.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  No. Why can't I just like a girl? [<i>Finn's tear drops onto Flame Princess's fire.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Ow! [<i>Looks angrily at Finn. She notices he's crying.</i>] Huh?

[<i>Dives as a fire towards Finn while she shrinks her size.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Coughs then faints.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Touches Finn's tears then jumps back</i>] Oh.

[<i>Flame Princess puts all of her fire out.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gasps for air then coughs; he sees Flame Princess by his side.</i>] Wah! Did I... do something... cool while I was knocked out?

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  I understand now. You're a <i>water </i>elemental.

<b>Finn</b>:  What?

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  You're my opposite. You create water.

<b>Finn</b>:  What, cry? No, I j--

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Yeah, you cry and cry all the time.

<b>Finn</b>:  N-No. I-I don't usually do that.

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  That's your power.

<b>Finn</b>:  No! N-N-N-NO-NO-NO! [<i>waves his hands while blushing.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Finn, even if we like each other, we're going to hurt each other.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, we don't have to. I can take it... I... I mean, can't we try?

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  You would defy nature for me?

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh... yeah, whatevs.

[<i>Finn and Flame Princess hug, Finn tries to bear the pain but pulls away.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Aaah.. Uh.

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  Bye, Finn. [<i>Departs</i>]

<b>Neptr</b>:  Goodbye, lady.

<b>Jake</b>:  FINN! [<i>Stretches up.</i>] Oh my Glob, man. Everyone's dead, man! They're all burned. There's barbecued bods EVERYWHERE!

<b>Finn</b>:  WHAAAAT!?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Hah. I'm just kidding. I saved 'em. Everyone's fine, see?

[<i>Jake gestures towards the crowd of unharmed goblins</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  So. How'd everything go with Flame Princess?

<b>Finn</b>:  She hugged me... then left.

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa! How did it feel?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Turns to the direction Flame Princess took while leaving a trail of fire behind.</i>] It hurt.
