<b>Jake</b>:  You've got a lot of meat, Wildberry Princess.

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  Yeah, well, you know.

<b>Finn</b>:  Thanks for cook-a-looking for us.

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  Oh, you're welcome, Finn, and thank you for answering my urgent summons.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, yeah. How can we aid thee? [<i>Eats a piece of pie</i>]

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  Oh, it's nothing really. Someone's trying to kill me.

[<i>Finn and Jake spit out their pies, their food flies in each other’s mouth, Finn gags</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Still tastes good.

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  It's no big deal. Finish your pie.

<b>Finn</b>:  It <i>is</i> a big deal, and I demand deets.

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  Okay.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Mouth full</i>] I'm listening, but I'm gonna keep eating. [<i>Chews pie tray</i>]

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  [<i>Goes over to a table</i>] I suspect that I've been targeted by the Guild of Assassins.

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa, how do you know?

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  I found this note stabbed to my door... man. [<i>Lifts up a note from the <a href="/wiki/Guild_of_Assassins" title="Guild of Assassins">Guild of Assassins</a> with a knife pierced through it</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] Princess, we vow to protect your juice. Right, Jake?

[<i>Jake is devouring a pie messily</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Sometimes, I think there's a monster who lives in my stomach, and that's why I'm hungry all the time. [<i>Giggles and continues eating</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhh, Princess, let's continue this briefing outside. I can't look at his mouth when he gets like this.

[<i>Close-up of Jake's mouth belching, Finn and Wildberry Princess leave the room. Jake puts down the pie tin and wipes his mouth, eyes another pie and taps the table with his arm</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Whispering</i>] Princess, want me to finish off your pie? [<i>Jake stretches his hand into a Wildberry Princess-shaped puppet and imitates her voice</i>] Yes, Jake. All my pies. [<i>Jake begins to eat the pie when he sees something inside it. He continues eating to find a small cat</i>] Hmm...hehehehehehe, a tiny cat. [<i>The cat hisses and bares her claws at Jake</i>] Whoa!

<b><a href="/wiki/Me-Mow" title="Me-Mow">Me-Mow</a></b>:  [<i>Jumps on Jake's face</i>] Quiet! Or you die! [<i>Points a syringe of poison at him</i>].

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] <i>You're</i> the assassin!

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  [<i>Saluting</i>] Me-mow, assassin second class, ...but once I take out a princess, I g'aduate to full membership.

<b>Jake</b>:  Well, I'm no princess, sister!

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  Yes, I know, but since you've blown my cover, <i>you</i> will slay Wildberry Princess.

<b>Jake</b>:  What!? I'd rather be injected with poison!

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  Oh. Uh... okay.

<b>Jake</b>:  I mean, I will assassinate Wildberry Princess.

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  Good. Oh, and if you try to trick me, I'll poison you. [<i>Climbs into Jake's nose</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Stifled</i>] My nose! [<i>It should be noted that until otherwise noted all lines from Me-mow show her inside of Jake's nose</i>]

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  Blagh! It's like worn garbage up in here!

(Finn and Wildberry Princess re-enter)

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  You done in there, Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, uh, yeah. So, um, Wildberry Princess. So, maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be killed.

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  [<i>Nervously backs off</i>] W-w-why would you say that?

<b>Finn</b>:  Dude, are you trying to freak her out?

<b>Jake</b>:  I don't know. I'm just thinking out loud here.

<b>Finn</b>:  Are you trying to freak <i>me</i> out?

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh, I'm sorry, Wildberry Prin...cess... [<i>Hears bells, looks at a bag of meat, grabs Wildberry Princess's crown</i>] You should... let me... do something... and... it will be...good. [<i>Places Wildberry Princess's crown on the meatbag</i>]

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  What's going on out there? [<i>Looks through Jake's nostril to see the meatbag with Wildberry Princess's crown</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Punching the meatbag</i>] Eat this! And that! Ooh, how do you like this, Princess! Duoo!

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  [<i>confused</i>] Uh... That's very good?

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm gonna pick you up now and carry you... to the window!

[<i>Jake carries meatbag to the window</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, what are you...

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  No! Stop! Please!

[<i>Me-mow smiles, Jake tosses meatbag out the window and it splats on the ground</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Wildberry Princess is dead! [<i>Puts a finger to his mouth</i>] Shh... [<i>Gives a thumbs up, Finn and Wildberry Princess are speechless</i>]

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  You did it! Well done! I guess I'll be on my way.

[<i>Goes to pick up her syringe when a voice pipes up</i>]

<b>Wildberry Guard #1</b>:  Princess! Oh, Princess! [<i><a href="/wiki/Wildberry_Guard" title="Wildberry Guard">Wildberry guards</a> rush into doorway</i>]

<b>Wildberry Guard #2</b>:  You're alive!

<b>Wildberry Guard #1</b>:  We saw your crown next to a pile of dirtied meat, then we skipped on the meat and I thought I tasted your juice, but it was just blood from the meat. We're so glad it wasn't actually you!

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  [<i>Angry yell</i>] Grraa!! You liar! [<i>She injects Jake with the half of the poison from the syringe</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>pained groan</i>] Oooh! [<i>Jake collapses over and his skin tint turns green</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake?

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  Okay, Jake. I've injected you with half the poison, you'll be dead in thirty minutes, unless you kill the princess, which is when I'll give you the antidote [<i>Me-mow holds up a tube of pink liquid with her tail</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn [<i>grabs Finn's shirt</i>] help me!

<b>Finn</b>:  What's wrong?

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  If you say anything, I'll stab you in the brain!

<b>Jake</b>:  Uhh... Finn, uh, sing mom's lullaby. I'm so tired, Finn, from the meat. Please, you have to lull me to sleep.

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhhh...

<b>Jake</b>:  I know you carry mom's music box around in your backpack!

<b>Finn</b>:  Dude, I'm not going to sing mom's lullaby in front of other people...

<b>Jake</b>:  Please, pleeeaaase...

<b>Finn</b>:  Alright, real quick while the princess is distracted. [<i>he pulls out the music box and starts playing it; he begins singing "<a href="/wiki/Sleepy_Puppies" title="Sleepy Puppies">Sleepy Puppies</a>"</i>].

[<i>Finn starts to fall over, lulled to sleep himself</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake catches Finn with his hand jolting him awake</i>] [<i>whispers</i>] Finn there's an assassin in my nose and she poisoned me and is making me kill Wildberry Princess!

<b>Finn</b>:  Dude, stop playing games! This is serious!

[<i>Jake covers Finn's mouth and grabs some meat from one of the pies and spells "cat → nose," but it's a bit sloppy</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Cat... noise? Oh, cats go "meow." Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.

<b>Jake</b>:  Shh!

<b>Finn</b>:  Meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow!

<b>Jake</b>:  Shh! Shh! Shh! [<i>Finn continues</i>]

[<i>Jake wraps Finn up in his arms to quiet him, Finn mumbles loudly</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>muffled</i>] Jake! Jake! What are you doing?!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>whispers</i>] Sorry... [<i>Jake throws Finn out the window onto the meat from earlier</i>] [<i>whispers again</i>] Me-mow? Still asleep?

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  [<i>asleep</i>] Gonna double cross Jake... and leave him to die...

<b>Jake</b>:  Phew... If I can just grab that antidote... [<i>He pokes Me-mows face twice then grabs it</i>] Ah-ha!

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  [<i>asleep</i>] Puppy... hoodies...

<b>Jake</b>:  I did it!

[<i>Finn comes back in the door</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What the flop, Jake!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>quiet</i>] Noooooo!!

<b>Me-mow</b>:  Treachery! Hiya! [<i>Me-mow injects Jake's hand with more poison</i>]

[<i>Jake groans in pain</i>]

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  Time's running out, Jake! Do you want the antidote, or not?

<b>Finn</b>:  What is wrong with you!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Clearly intoxicated</i>] Hey, everybody, everything's cool...

<b>Finn</b>:  Everything's <i>not</i> cool, Wildberry Princess is still in danger!

<b>Jake</b>:  Right, right, well, we should take her somewhere safer...

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  Don't make me give you the rest.

<b>Jake</b>:  I know where to stash you, princess. Follow me. [<i>Jake walks out</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts to the top of a high cliff</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Here, nobody can take us by surprise. Finn, stand here with your back to the cliff. I'll stay with Wildberry Princess. [<i>gravely</i>] To do what must be done. [<i>He prepares his hands to push Wildberry Princess</i>]

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  Oh, my, look at how close to the edge I am!

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  Do it, Jake, do it!

<b>Jake</b>:  I...I...I probably shouldn't!

[<i>A bird swoops down trying to eat one of the sausages in Jake's ears; it hits him in the head and knocks Me-mow out onto the grass</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh? Jake!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Falls over weakly</i>] I'm full of poison...

<b>Finn</b>:  The assassin!

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  The name's Me-mow.

<b>Finn</b>:  If you let Jake die, so help me I will kill you too!

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  Try it, oaf!

<b>Finn</b>:  Give me the antidote!

[<i>Me-mow jumps on Finn's arm and runs around to his back and up his head in a comically long sequence demonstrating her size, she then jumps in a tree</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Face me, cat!

[<i>Me-mow spits a knife out of her throat, and climbs down a tree, same as previous style. She puts a small cut in Finn's leg</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ugh, ow!

[<i>Me-mow slices one of Finn's backpack straps and gives him a small cut on the cheek</i>]

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  [<i>shrieks, bent over the weakened Jake</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Give it up, Me-mow! You're only making my face look cooler!

[<i>Finn throws his sword at Me-mow who is on a branch; it misses and gets stuck in the tree</i>]

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  You're at my mercy!

<b>Finn</b>:  Ha, you think you're hurting me? With that tiny dagger?

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  We'll see who's laughing when you're blind!

[<i>Me-mow jumps at Finn's face, but he blows her away knocking her into a tree. Finn goes up to pin her to the tree, she puts her knife out and Finn puts his hand on it. He grunts but holds her</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  It's over! Give me the antidote!

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  What, this antidote? [<i>Me-mow breaks the antidote on the tree</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  No! You... milk-lapper! [<i>Finn punches Me-mow out of his grip</i>] Jake, come lick this treebark!

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm coming-- [<i>he starts crawling, but immediately puts his face to the ground</i>]

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  Forget it, kid. I gave Jake enough poison to kill a dog fifty times his size.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, no... [<i>starts crying next to Jake</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake [<i>in unison</i>]</b>:  Wait, oh yeah! [<i>Jake grows his liver to enormous size</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Dog liver times fifty-one!

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  A magic dog? Nooo!

<b>Finn</b>:  How you feeling, dude?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>singing like a rockstar</i>] Big liver, big liver, yeah!!

<b>Me-Mow</b>:  You've ruined me! I have to wait a whole year to retake the assassins test!

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  Aww! How 'bout I made you my royal pet?

[<i>Me-mow jumps at Wildberry Princess in an attempt to attack her, but her berries pop off and Me-mow misses careening off the cliff</i>]

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  Oh, dear....

<b>Finn</b>:  Nice defense mechanism, Wild B!

<b>Jake</b>:  Are you naked?

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  Oh, no, this is a medical condition. I need a hospital [<i>groans</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hehe, we <i>all</i> need a hospital.

[<i>Finn and Jake laugh as they walk off with Wildberry Princess</i>]
