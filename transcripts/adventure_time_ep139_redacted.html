[<i>The episode begins with <a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a> walking down a path in a forest.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What... is the meaning of "soup"?

<b>Jake</b>: What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest—?

<b>Finn</b>: What... is the meaning of "spoon"?

<b>Jake</b>: Shoot, man, are you still lady-sad about <a href="/wiki/Flame_Princess" title="Flame Princess">Flame Princess</a>? Y'know, it's okay if you are.

<b>Finn</b>: Naw, that's all fine. I just been feeling kind of... gray, is all. Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately. Not a lot of instructions forthcoming, y'know?

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, Finn, girls is like horses. When you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again—on a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea. A lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned.

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, I-I guess. Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle.

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, man, yeah!

<b>Finn</b>: Or, like, if you mess up, you could get really hurt forever, or hurt someone you really care about.

<b>Jake</b>: Eh, well, I suppose. Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as <a href="/wiki/Flambo" title="Flambo">Flambo</a>'s brother says it is. Maybe that'll snap you out of the—[<i>stops walking</i>] Whoa! What?!

[<i>He walks up to a train, which is passing by on its tracks.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way!

<b>Finn</b>: Relax, buddy. We'll just cross after it passes. No big thing, really.

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, yeah.

[<i>Finn is now sleeping on the ground.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: It's two hours later now. What the stunk? [<i><a href="/wiki/Stretchy_Powers" title="Stretchy Powers">stretches</a> up above the train, seeing that the train is going around in a circular track</i>] Oh, okay. [<i>stretches back down</i>] Hey, the train just goes in a big circle! We can cut right through the middle, blingle, blongle, blungle! Come on! [<i>grabs Finn and stretches them onto the train</i>] Wha-hey! You know, I just had another idea! If we just stay put here on the train, we could ride it all the way to the cave. [<i>a door opens behind them</i>] Blingle, blongle, blungle!

[<i>A creature comes running toward them screaming.</i>]

<b>Creature</b>: Gimme! Gimme the loot! [<i>hits Finn's head</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Ow!

[<i>The creature stomps on Finn's toes.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Yeeow!

<b>Creature</b>: Gimme! Gimme that hat! [<i>grabs Finn's hat</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Knock it off! [<i>punches him in the chest and bites his arm</i>]

<b>Creature</b>: Aah!

[<i>Finn pushes him off the train.</i>]

<b>Creature</b>: Oh, dang!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>laughs</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, Finn!

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa!

<b>Jake</b>: Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt!

<b>Finn</b>: Dang, look at that sword! [<i>picks up the Lightning Sword</i>] Whoa. Feels kinda right. [<i>waving it around</i>] Whoosh. Whoosh. Vvsh, vvsh. [<i>points it at the wall, causing it to shoot electricity</i>] [<i>laughs</i>] Whoa!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Pretty fun, huh?

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, man! It's spicy baby fun!

<b>Jake</b>: You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train?

<b>Finn</b>: Yes! [<i>runs off</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>following him</i>] [<i>laughs</i>]

[<i>They enter a different car of the train, where some blue ants await, holding loot in each hand.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa, <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Ants" title="Crystal Ants">Crystal Ants</a>, I think! [<i>runs past them, zapping each with his sword</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Cool! [<i>picks up loot</i>] [<i>laughs</i>]

[<i>They enter another car, where some rock monsters moan and walk toward them.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Ha-ha! Yeah! [<i>slicing each one</i>] Die, die, die, die, die, die, die! [<i>laughs</i>]

[<i>Scene changes to Finn fighting several monsters in quick succession. The last one explodes, getting some of its goo on Jake.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>to himself</i>] Welcome back, buddy.

<b>Finn</b>: Man, look at all this rad loot!

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday.

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa, what do you mean? We just started only, like, three hours ago.

<b>Jake</b>: Heheh, yeah. I'm just gettin' a little bored, is all. All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same. It's a little boring.

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, come on. [<i>elbows him lightly</i>] It's fun! Just one more car. Come on. [<i>elbows him</i>] Come on, man! [<i>elbows him again</i>] Come on!

<b>Jake</b>: All right, just one more.

<b>Finn</b>: Ha-ha, yes!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>sighs</i>]

[<i>They enter another car, but this one appears empty.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm? Where is everybody?

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, hey! Empty car—think we beat it, buddy.

[<i>A door opens behind them, out of which comes a chubby green monster with a crown that shoot fires.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa, man! Boss battle! Let's chew it up! [<i>runs toward the monster</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Okay, but this is the last one, okay?

<b>Finn</b>: We'll see!

[<i>The monster trips Finn and blasts fire at him, singeing his hat.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Ha-ha!

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, man, [<i>hitting monster with a stick</i>] you remember we were going to that weird cave? Bet it's not too late to check it out.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>attacking monster</i>] Eh, weird cave, weird train—I'm cool here.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Okay.

<b>Finn</b>: Hyah! [<i>hits the monster's crown</i>]

[<i>A head grows out of the monster underneath its crown.</i>]

<b>Head</b>: Ahhhh, gimme a break!

[<i>The monster disappears in a flash of light and drops loot.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Oh? Oh, dang. Boss loot! [<i>puts on the crown and dances</i>] Oh, yeah. [<i>the crown emits fire</i>]

[<i>Jake picks up the rest of the loot and tries on a glove, which makes him chubby and green like the monster. He quickly takes it off, throws it on the ground, and kicks it away.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: No, thank you.

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, hurry. Next car!

[<i>They enter the next car, which contains green jelly creatures.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Slime crimes! [<i>starts fighting</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: You have fun. I'm just gonna watch. [<i>sits on a ledge away from the fight</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>sees a gold shield one monster dropped</i>] Hey.

[<i>A monster squirts some green liquid at Finn, hitting the back of his leg.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Ow! [<i>laughing</i>] Ow. Cool... acid!

[<i>The monster squirts again, but Finn picks up the shield and reflects it back at it, killing it. Finn walks over to the loot it dropped. Jake's stomach rumbles.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, gettin' kinda hungry?

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, man. I guess we've been here for a while.

<b>Jake</b>: More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window!

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break.

<b>Jake</b>: 'Kay! Well, we'll go back to the <a href="/wiki/Tree_Fort" title="Tree Fort">tree house</a>, and I'll make us some lunch. I could make the toaster pancakes you like.

[<i>Finn kills a monster, which drops some meat.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs, or—

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>eating noisily</i>] Look. [<i>points to meat</i>] Now we don't gotta do that thing you wanted to do. [<i>uses his crown's flames to throw the meat at Jake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>dodging it</i>] Aah!

<b>Finn</b>: Hot meat!

[<i>The scene changes to Finn entering another car, in which red ants await.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Ants again? [<i>goes to sit in the corner</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: "Ant" no thang! [<i>smashes one</i>] Yah! [<i>smashes another</i>] Caught with your "ants" down! "Ants" for nothin'! [<i>kills another</i>] Forget about "ant"! [<i>kicks one</i>] What's wrong? Feeling antsy? [<i>kills another and continues killing them</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. We did all the ants!

<b>Finn</b>: Same car, [<i>punches an ant</i>] but those were blue ants. These are red ants.

<b>Jake</b>: Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you.

<b>Finn</b>: Man, no way. All this feels good. [<i>smashes another ant</i>] Like my inside voice is saying, "Hey, keep it up. This is good stuff." [<i>two ants attack him</i>] Aah! Hey! [<i>knocks them away</i>] Ah! Like when you made those biscuits way back? And I kept eating them until they were all gone. Like that!

<b>Jake</b>: Finn, [<i>stands up</i>] I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter!

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah! [<i>smashes the last ant</i>]

[<i>A door opens, out of which comes the second boss.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Boss fight! [<i>charges at it, blasting fire from his crown</i>]

[<i>The monster raises its wand and blasts Finn backwards.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>gets back up and continues fighting offscreen</i>]

[<i>Blasts from the monster's wand zoom by Jake, who is sitting in a corner. He picks up a pair of pants that one of the ants dropped and puts them on. Finn grunts and an explosion sounds.</i>]

<b>Boss</b>: My jacket-sta! [<i>disappears in a flash of light</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>holding loot</i>] Check it out: <a href="/wiki/Battle_moon" title="Battle moon">battle moon</a>.

<b>Jake</b>: What? [<i>picks it up and looks in it</i>] [<i>gasps</i>] Finn! This is a <a href="/wiki/Future_crystal" title="Future crystal">future crystal</a>! Look!

[<i>In the sphere is Finn in full armor, battling yellow Crystal Ants</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: That's you, dude! You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train!

<b>Future Finn</b>: [<i>slashes the ants</i>] Get "ant" of town.

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa. I'm gonna have the best life!

[<i>Jake gapes.</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts to them entering another car. Jake kicks the wall, and some <a href="/wiki/Hair_Apes" title="Hair Apes">Hair Apes</a> shoot lightning at Finn, who blocks it with his shield.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, Hair Apes!

<b>Jake</b>: Nuh-uh, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm goin' back to the tree house. [<i>opens up the side of the train</i>] You can come with me if you want.

<b>Finn</b>: What? No, man! It's better on the train; stuff makes sense here.

<b>Hair Ape</b>: [<i>hoots</i>] [<i>zaps Finn</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Yow! [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>shoots a bolt from his wand at the ape, killing it</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair.

<b>Finn</b>: You'll be back.

<b>Jake</b>: No, I won't, Finn. [<i>hops onto the outside of the train</i>] Goodbye!

[<i>He makes it sound like he's getting farther away by making his face smaller. He looks back in at Finn.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>]

[<i>A Hair Ape shoots some lightning at Finn, but his battle moon blocks it.</i>]

<b>Hair Ape</b>: [<i>hoots</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hey! [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>runs toward it</i>] "Hair" we go!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>climbs on top of the rain, finding a Hair Ape</i>] What're you doin' up here?

<b>Hair Ape</b>: [<i>hoots</i>] [<i>shrugs</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>takes off his hat and sits next to it</i>] Are you gettin' sick of things down there, too?

<b>Hair Ape</b>: [<i>hoots</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Mm-hmm.

[<i>He takes off <a href="/wiki/Jake%27s_pack" title="Jake's pack">his pack</a>, and the Hair Ape pats his leg invitingly.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: You're not gonna try and zap me, are you?

[<i>The Hair Ape shrugs. Jake rests his head on the Hair Ape's leg and looks up at the stars.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: I wonder what my kids are doin'. [<i>falls asleep</i>]

[<i>Morning arrives, and Jake hears the Hair Ape rubbing his hands together to zap him.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hey! [<i>dodges zap</i>] I knew it!

[<i>He hits the Hair Ape, which disappears in a flurry of hair. He then picks up his pack, puts on his hat, and picks up the Hair Ape's hat.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>walks off</i>] Gotta find that kid. Hey, Finn! [<i>opens door</i>] Fi—oh! [<i>sees someone with a metal helmet, a <a href="/wiki/Flame_cloak" title="Flame cloak">cloak of fire</a>, and a battle moon</i>] Umm... hey, there, friend. I ain't lookin' for no trouble. Just lookin' for my friend, Finn. Maybe you seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kinda smells funny l—

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, hey! Jake, it's me! [<i>opens visor to helmet</i>] I'm just all souped up now.

<b>Jake</b>: Ah, jeez, Finn. I... for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted-lost-soul boss guys.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>wiggles his tongue</i>] Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl.

<b>Jake</b>: Wait, you are! You are one!

<b>Finn</b>: What? Those guys are cool!

<b>Jake</b>: That's it, man! I'm gettin' you off this train whether you like it or not! [<i>advancing toward him</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, stay back. I mean it!

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, please. What're you gonna do? I'm ten times stronger than—

[<i>Finn squirts a large amount of silk at him with his <a href="/wiki/Spider_wand" title="Spider wand">spider wand</a>.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>laughs</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Ah, gross! [<i>coughs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>grabs Jake's pack</i>] Yoink! [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>runs to the next car</i>] Pff, Jake—tryin' to tell <i>me</i> what to do. Pff, yeah, right. I tells me what to do. Now let's see what we got here. [<i>reaches into Jake's pack</i>] Apple, apple, chicken, apple... [<i>pulls out future crystal</i>] Oh, yeah, that little orb in which I rule! Let's see that again, orb. [<i>the crystal reveals an old Finn, followed by someone</i>] Yeah, that's right. Lookin' right. [<i>laughs</i>] Wait a second, who's that sad ward little guy followin' me around? [<i>camera zooms in</i>] Jake? All those years—he stayed with me.

<b>Future Jake</b>: Finn, can we slow down? My feet hurt.

<b>Future Finn</b>: What?

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, Jake. Hang in there, buddy. I'ma set this right.

[<i>He gets up, and his battle moon falls. He makes his way toward Jake, taking off his helmet on the way.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Finn? Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you, I swear. Just get this stuff off of me.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>using wand to take back silk</i>] No, <i>I'm</i> sorry, Jake. I messed up, but don't worry. It's all over now.

<b>Jake</b>: You mean we're gettin' off the train?

<b>Finn</b>: Well... <i>you</i> are. I'm gonna keep playin' for a while. I'll meet you back home in a week or two.

<b>Jake</b>: Aw, man, don't you see that's just the train talkin'? It's got its hooks in you! [<i>hits Finn's head lightly</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] No, no for real! [<i>pats forehead</i>] My inside is tellin' me it's time. Here, [<i>hands Jake the future crystal</i>] see for yourself.

[<i>The crystal displays Finn and Jake washing dishes at the Tree Fort.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, man. <i>That's</i> what I'm talkin' about. That... is what I'm talkin' about.
