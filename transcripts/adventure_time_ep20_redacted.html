[<i>The episode begins with <a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a> in tall grass.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Safety! [<i>Jumping out</i>] Patrol!

<b>Jake</b>:  Safety! [<i>Jumping out</i>] Patrol! Safety patrol! Safety— Oh... Were we not wearing the uniforms?

<b>Finn</b>:  C'mon. Let's keep lookin' for hazards. Look out!

<b>Jake</b>:  What is it, dude?

<b>Finn</b>:  Shushers, man! [<i>Pointing at village</i>] Look there!

<b>Jake</b>:  Just looks like an ordinary little town, man.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah... [<i>Puts on binoculars</i>] Suspiciously ordinary. Oh! Little <a href="/wiki/House_People" title="House People">house people</a>! Maybe it is just regular ordinary, not sinister ordinary—oh, no, wait... Grass ogre.

<b><a href="/wiki/Donny_(character)" title="Donny (character)">Donny</a></b>:  Haha! [<i>Putting chicken in mailbox</i>] Hey, chicken, you're travelin' egg-spress! [<i>Laughs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  It's an obnoxious grass ogre.

<b>Donny</b>:  You get my joke, right?! Hahaha!

<b>Barn House</b>:  Careful, you oaf! Those chickens are rentals! [<i>Donny fires an egg at him.</i>] Agh!

<b>Donny</b>:  [<i>Firing eggs</i>] We're havin' so much fun, huh?!

<b>Jail House</b>:  Drop that chicken!

<b>Donny</b>:  [<i>Stopping</i>] Huh?

<b>Jail House</b>:  You're under arrest! [<i>Donny comes over and drops the chicken.</i>] Good... Now get in your tiny cell... Oh, uh, oh!

[<i>Donny picks up the Jail House Person and lays him down on his back. Donny laughs.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, ogre! Stop hazing these cute little houses!

<b>Jake</b>:  Ya jerkball!

<b>Donny</b>:  My name is Donny, idiot!

<b>Finn</b>:  Sorry. I was just tryina' get your attention.

<b>Donny</b>:  What kinda houses are you supposed to be? A... stupid... uh... a dumb house?! Haha! Hey, what's with your jowl?! [<i>Flicks Jake's jowl</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Ow!

<b>Donny</b>:  Hahaha! I'm gonna mess with these housies some more.

<b>Finn</b>:  NEVER!!

[<i>Finn runs up to Donny and jumps on his back, attempting to stop him.</i>]

<b>Donny</b>:  So you wanna wrestle, huh? 'Cause I know, like, this ninja move to get out of this lock instantly! Okay... Now, first I... [<i>Finn squeezes Donny.</i>] Hey! You're doin' it wrong!!

[<i>Jake wiggles his finger and stretches one of them out.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To himself</i>] Whoa.

<b>Finn</b>:  You're doin' it wrong!

<b>Donny</b>:  Whaddaya mean?

<b>Finn</b>:  First, you roll your right shoulder forward...

[<i>Donny picks Finn up</i>]

<b>Donny</b>:  Like this?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, but then I counter it by doin' this! [<i>He grabs Donny again and squeezes.</i>]

<b>Donny</b>:  Hey!

[<i>Donny begins to pant heavily.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Um... You need to take a break?

<b>Donny</b>:  No... but if you need to, we can stop... [<i>Finn gets off</i>] Ya baby.

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa, I zoned out there for a bit. Did you win?

<b>Finn</b>:  Nah. Just takin' five. Donny's pretty good.

<b>Donny</b>:  Yeah, well, you're okay, too.

<b>Finn</b>:  Thanks, man.

<b>Donny</b>:  ...For a complete idiot!

<b>Finn</b>:  Aww...

[<i>Donny laughs</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Donald, quit all this jerky nonsense! [<i>Forms giant, tree-like ears</i>] Unless you wanna get gored by a forest prince!

<b>Donny</b>:  I was just kiddin' around, but then you took it too far! You guys are the real jerks! [<i>Donny mumbles, scoffs, and runs off.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Donny is one mixed-up dude.

<b>Finn</b>:  Nah. He's just rough-and-tumble, like me, but deep down, he's probably really sensitive, like me.

<b>Jake</b>:  You're a mixed-up dude, too!

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, Donny!

<b>Donny</b>:  What?

<b>Finn</b>:  I was thinkin' that since you're a pretty good wrestler, maybe you'd wanna hang out with a couple a' rascals like me and Jake!

<b>Jake</b>:  What?

<b>Donny</b>:  Muuuh... I don't know. Messin' with these housies is pretty fun. You got somethin' better?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To Finn</i>] You sure this is a good idea?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To Donny</i>] If you come to the Tree Fort, we got video games and apple juice!

<b>Donny</b>:  [<i>Eager</i>] Really?! [<i>Pulling back, pretending not to care</i>] I mean... if it keeps you from cryin'...

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To Jake</i>] Donny's problem is that he's treated like an outsider, like me.

<b>Jake</b>:  You are not an outsider. You wear cute little blue shorts!

<b>Finn</b>:  I... am complicated.

[<i>Scene transition; the three are at the Tree Fort.</i>]

<b>Donny</b>:  Uh... This fort isn't so great. Not as cool as the fort I'm gonna build. [<i>Sitting down</i>] I call this chair!

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, Donny, you should play Bug Battle.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Putting game in BMO</i>] And hey, can you put on some pants?!

<b>Donny</b>:  You put on some pants!

<b>Jake</b>:  I have pants... [<i>Grabs transparent pants</i>] spun from spiderwebs... by pixies.

[<i>The game starts.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To Donny</i>] Okay. There's you, and here come the bugs.

[<i>Donny destroys the bugs in the game. Donny starts laughing. Suddenly, a spider drops from above and kills the video game character.</i>]

<b>Donny</b>:  Huh?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, yeah. Those guys'll get ya.

<b>Donny</b>:  [<i>Breaking controller</i>] Urgh!! This game cheats! [<i>Throws controller parts at BMO, knocking it down</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Not cool, dude.

<b>Finn</b>:  Have more apple juice. It always makes me feel better when I— [<i>Donny splashes the apple juice in Finn's face.</i>] Aaah! Donny! Quit being a jerk!

<b>Donny</b>:  What? What'd I do?

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn, I don't think this is gonna work.

<b>BMO</b>:  I am incapable of all emotion.... but you are making me chafed!!

<b>Donny</b>:  Everybody's gettin' mad at me for nothin'!

<b>Finn</b>:  You have to think about how your actions make other people feel.

<b>Donny</b>:  Ohh. Hmm. I don't understand at all.

<b>Jake</b>:  Ooh! Teach him that little empathy song I taught you!

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay, yeah! [<i>Singing</i>] Empathy, empathy, put yourself in the place of me! [<i>Speaking</i>] Your turn!

<b>Donny</b>:  Uh... Empathy, empathy, put yourself... Ohh! So it's like, when I squeeze eggs outta chickens, I should let them squeeze eggs outta me, too!

<b>Finn</b>:  ...Um... kinda right. [<i>Screams are heard.</i>] Someone needs our help! Jake, you stay here and try to fix him, while I deal with an unknown possibly deadly emergency! [<i>Runs off</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude, trade me jobs.

[<i>A loud crash is heard.</i>]

<b>Donny</b>:  Jake! Someone broke your... um... entire living room!

[<i>Jake slaps his hand against his face. The scene changes to the house "village" where werewolves are terrorizing the House People.</i>]

<b>Bank House</b>:  Quick! Act abandoned!

[<i>He and the Girl With Glasses House do so. The wolf growls at the Dog House, and Finn punches him.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hands off the housing market! [<i>The wolf attacks Finn.</i>] BACKPACK! [<i>Finn blocks the wolf's attack with his pack.</i>] Werewolves. Much worse than ogres. [<i>Runs</i>]

<b>Jail House</b>:  Stop in the name of the law!

[<i>Finn grabs the Jail House and keeps running.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Is there somewhere I can trap that thing?

<b>Jail House</b>:  Well, there was a zoo, but he moved back east. Course, there's always the old well.

<b>Well</b>:  I'm not old!

<b>Finn</b>:  Perfect! [<i>Finn leads the wolf up to the well and kicks it down.</i>] Slam-bam-in-a-can! Huh? Another werewolf?!? What's up with this town?!

[<i>A Siamese twin wolf bites attacks the bank house. Finn forces the wolf into the well with another House Person.</i>

<b>Finn</b>:  Mr. Bank! Are you alright?!

<b>Bank House</b>:  Oh, it's fine, it's fine. All my assets are insured. Pardon. [<i>Leaving</i>] I have to go spackle my cracks.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To himself</i>] Why is this town just getting worse and worse?

<b>Wolf</b>:  [<i>From inside old well</i>] Yes! Why indeed!!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To werewolf</i>] Hey! What are you werewolves up to?!

<b>Wolf</b>:  We're not werewolves... [<i>The wolf reveals a suit he's wearing.</i>] [<i>Calmer common voice</i>] We're <a href="/wiki/Why-wolves" title="Why-wolves">Why-wolves</a>.

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh... Why-wolves?

<b>Why-wolf</b>:  Creatures possessed by the spirit of inquiry..... [<i>Growling voice</i>] AND... BLOODLUST!!

<b>Finn</b>:  What?!

<b>Why-wolf</b>:  [<i>Normal voice</i>] Please. Save your questions until the end of the lecture. [<i>Demonstrating by drawing on dirt</i>] Our ecosystem. At the bottom level are the house people. Given the opportunity, we Why-wolves would easily wipe them out. However, Donny's presence is a natural deterrent. His jerkiness is so powerful that it produces a pungent gas—<a href="/wiki/Obnoxygen" title="Obnoxygen">obnoxygen</a>. To Why-wolves, it is a deadly poison. But since you've removed the jerk Donny, we will devour the houses, and our population will rapidly swell until we are, in turn, devoured by the <a href="/wiki/Cosmic_Owl" title="Cosmic Owl">Cosmic Owl</a>. Such is the course of nature, but it'll be a pretty sweet ride up until that point. [<i>Growling voice</i>] TONIGHT, WE FEAST ON THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS! [<i>He howls. The Siamese twin Why-wolf laughs maliciously.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, no! I have to get Donny back!

[<i>Scene shifts back to the Tree Fort. Finn barges in.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Talking quickly</i>] Donny, you have to go right now, and stop the Why-wolves from—

[<i>Donny is playing a cello and Jake his viola.</i>]

<b>Donny</b>:  [<i>Pleasantly</i>] Ah! Master Finn has returned!

<b>Finn</b>:  What's it goin'?!

<b>Donny</b>:  Thanks to you, I shall never be jerky again!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, no... Oh, no. Oh, no, nonononononono! No! This is all wrong! We need jerk Donny to make the obnoxygen, and, and—

<b>Donny</b>:  Steady on, Finn. Perhaps you are dehydrated! It's as Jake taught me: [<i>Singing</i>] "8 ounces, 8 glasses, 8 days a week!" [<i>Speaking</i>] I'll fetch you some tap water.

<b>Finn</b>:  Are you wearing jeans now?!

<b>Donny</b>:  Surely! [<i>Singing</i>] Gotta get pants! Go get your pants! Button, fly! I wrote that one myself. Perdoname. [<i>Leaves</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  But, but, but—

<b>Jake</b>:  Butt, butt, butt! Yeah, Donny! You're lookin' good in those jeans!

<b>Finn</b>:  What did you do?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Miraculous, isn't it? I just kept teachin' him my musical rules, and now, he's perfect.

<b>Finn</b>:  No! We messed up, Jake! The House People are doomed if Donny doesn't go back to being town jerk!

<b>Donny</b>:  [<i>Clears throat</i>] I have no intention of being a jerk again. Hmph.

<b>Finn</b>:  But the housies will be wiped out if you don't!

<b>Donny</b>:  It sounds tragic, but I'm turning over a new leaf! [<i>Literally does so</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Donny, you gotta go!

<b>Donny</b>:  Finn, "no" means, "no." I'm sure you'll respect my wishes. [<i>Cut to Finn and Jake forcefully dragging Donny to the village</i>] No! Stop! No!

<b>Finn</b>:  Now, go be a jerk to those Why-wolves!

<b>Donny</b>:  No! I'll use my musical messages to stop them! [<i>Finn and Jake hang their mouths open, not believing what they are hearing.</i>] Let's see... I've got one on the ethics of laundry... Crosswalk-ery... Ooh! Here's a good one!

<b>Finn</b>:  Man! The town is getting creamed! By not being a jerk, you're being a real jerk, Donny!!

<b>Donny</b>:  [<i>Singing</i>] Comb your hair right! It's a good time! Sticky, sticky pomades, short back and sides! [<i>No one responds</i>] [<i>Speaking</i>] Why isn't anybody paying attention to my words?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To Jake</i>] He sure is sensitive about his songs! [<i>Gasps</i>] [<i>To Donny</i>] It's cuz they think your songs are dumb!

<b>Donny</b>:  Wha?!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To Finn</i>] What're you saying?! If you don't encourage his talent, he might revert back to jerk Do— [<i>In realization</i>] OHHH, OHHH! [<i>To Donny</i>] HEY, DONNY! EVERYONE SAYS YOUR SONGS ARE SUPER BALLS!!

<b>Finn</b>:  They all think you're a real jerk!

<b>Donny</b>:  But... but I've changed! Why would they say that?! [<i>Singing weakly</i>] Empathy, empathy, put your mind insi...

[<i>The Why-wolves and House People laugh at him.</i>]

<b>Why-wolf</b>:  You're so pathetic! So comical!

[<i>The Bank House laughs at him.</i>]

<b>Donny</b>:  [<i>Getting angry</i>] Rrrrr... Think I'm a jerk do they? I'm feelin'.. obnoxious!! [<i>He rips out of his clothes in rage.</i>] HEY, YOU WHY-WOLVES ARE COOL! JUST KIDDING! [<i>Releasing obnoxygen</i>] HAHAHAHA!!

<b>Why-wolf</b>:  Obnoxygen cloud!! EGRESS!!

[<i>The Why-wolves run away howling. Donny pants heavily.</i>]

<b>House People</b>:  The town is saved!!

[<i>The housies gather around Donny in celebration.</i>]

<b>Donny</b>:  Get offa' me, nerds!!

<b>Finn</b>:  You did it, Donny! You're a full-blown jerk again!

<b>Donny</b>:  What?! You're the jerk!! Housies! Ready to hear my new song?! It's about how Finn will betray you, just to save lives!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gravely</i>] I'm sorry, Donny.

<b>Donny</b>:  I'll never forgive you, Finn!! [<i>Angrily spraying House People with eggs</i>] WAAAAAAH!!!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To Finn</i>] C'mon. We can go stare wistfully at the lake.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Tired</i>] I'd... I'd like that. Very much.

[<i>Donny continues pelting the housies with eggs, laughing.</i>]

<b>Donny</b>:  Hey! I love bein' a jerk! Thanks, Finn! Finn? [<i>The heroes have left.</i>] Finn, you loser! [<i>Whispering</i>] I'll never... forget you!

[<i>The episode ends with the Adventure Time logo swirling onto the screen.</i>]
