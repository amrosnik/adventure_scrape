<b>Jake</b>:  I don't wanna talk about it.

[<i>Camera becomes someone's point of view. The person is viewing Finn and Jake; the person rushes towards Finn. Finn feels a gust of wind and hears a noise. He spits out his food.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What was <i>that</i>?

<b>Jake</b>:  Probably an owl. [<i>Takes a bite of his hot dog</i>] Mm... Mm, mm... [<i>Spits out his food</i>] A <i>ghost</i>!!

[<i><a href="/wiki/Ghost_Princess_(character)" title="Ghost Princess (character)">Ghost Princess</a> is seen floating towards them.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Dude. It's just Ghost Princess. Hey, GP. [<i>She howls.</i>] [<i>Whispering to Jake</i>] She's weird, huh? [<i>Ghost Princess gets closer to Finn and howls again.</i>] How's it goin'?

[<i>She flies around and howls some more.</i>]

<b>Ghost Princess</b>:  Sorry... It's just... I'm doomed to haunt this mortal plane...

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh. Well, let's hear more about <i>that</i>, honey.

<b>Ghost Princess</b>:  Until I discover the cause of my death, my soul can't ascend to the 50th <a href="/wiki/Dead_World" title="Dead World" class="mw-redirect">Dead World</a>. But as a ghost, I have no memory of my mortal life... and no idea how I died...

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] It's a crime case!

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa, step back, nephew. We don't know she was moidered!

<b>Finn</b>:  That's right. We don't even know <i>how</i> she was moida'd, but I'm the hard-boiled sleuth who's gonna crack your case wiiiide open!

<b>Ghost Princess</b>:  OH! That sounds wonderful!

[<i>Scene transitions to Ghost Princess's home cemetery.</i>]

<b>Ghost Princess</b>:  This way, gentlemen!

[<i>The three enter.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa. Your neighborhood is... uh... very peaceful.

<b>Ghost Princess</b>:  It's the cradle of my despair...

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Awkwardly</i>] Right, right.

<b>Ghost Princess</b>:  Well... here's me.

[<i>Finn slides off Jake and goes to a grave.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Our first clue! [<i>Reading grave</i>] "Female." It's a good start, but we need more. Jake, it's time to interrogate the neighbors. We'll do it good cop bad cop style. I CALL BAD COP!

<b>Jake</b>:  Awww...

[<i>Finn walks over to a grave.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Yo, ghost! Yo, yo! Yo, wake up, fool! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

[<i><a href="/wiki/Boilbee" title="Boilbee">Ghost</a> comes out of grave</i>]

<b>Boilbee</b>:  What?!?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Yo, ghost, whaddaya know about the lady buried next to you?

<b>Ghost Princess</b>:  He's right...! [<i>Starts crying</i>]

<b>Boilbee</b>:  And don't think I don't see what you do, Ghost Princess.

<b>Ghost Princess</b>:  What...?

<b>Boilbee</b>:  Sneakin' off at night, scarin' peeps, hauntin' at all hours... 'cause you can't deal with your issues!

[<i>Ghost Princess gasps and cries again. Boilbee chuckles. A cheese puff is thrown at him.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Clarence" title="Clarence">Clarence</a></b>:  Leave her <i>be</i>, Boilbee.

<b>Boilbee</b>:  Whaaat?

<b>Clarence</b>:  A princess deserves empathy, not your <i>sass</i>. [<i>Throws another cheese puff at him</i>]

[<i>Ghost Princess gapes in awe.</i>]

<b>Boilbee</b>:  Nyeee... nyeee... Butt out, Clarence!

<b>Clarence</b>:  Some of us still want to feel, you know? The vital... [<i>Eats another cheese puff</i>] ...magnetism of life. [<i>Ghost Princess stares in amazement.</i>] The vibrating energies that connect all living and... <i>nonliving</i> beings.

<b>Boilbee</b>:  Nyaaargh! I don't like your words! Arrrgh... [<i>Sinks back in the ground</i>]

<b>Ghost Princess</b>:  [<i>To Clarence</i>] I'm Ghost Princess. Have we met before? I feel like we <i>have</i>.

<b>Clarence</b>:  Did you try looking yonder? [<i>Points away</i>] That's where the <a href="/wiki/Muscular_Ghosts" title="Muscular Ghosts">ne'er-do-well ghosts</a> hang out.

<b>Finn</b>:  Right... Ne'er-do-wellers. Let's do this, Jake.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To Ghost Princess and Clarence, running off with Finn</i>] You stay, and eat cheese puffs!

[<i>The two ghosts throw cheese puffs into each other's mouths and laugh. Scene cuts to the ne'er-do-well ghosts' graveyard.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Pants heavily</i>] Well, you're lucky my partner's here... pal.

<b>Jake</b>:  He's not worth it, man.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Grunts</i>] These ghosts think I'm playin'. They think it's all a big game. But you know what? You know what I'm gonna do?

<b>Jake</b>:  What?

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm gonna turn this game... UP-SIDE-DOWN!!! [<i>His voice echoes.</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts to the location of the <a href="/wiki/Spirit_Waves" title="Spirit Waves">Spirit Waves</a> show. Ghost Princess and Clarence are there.</i>]

<b>Ghost Princess</b>:  So, you really don't know how <i>you</i> died <i>either</i>?

<b>Clarence</b>:  Of course not. [<i>To ticket vendor</i>] Two, please. [<i>To Ghost Princess</i>] And we might never find out, but that's okay because right now, in this moment, I'm feeling pretty sweetles, you know?

<b>Jake</b>:  What <i>is</i> it, dude??

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Low, growling voice</i>] ...We gotta dig up the princess.
