[<i>The episode begins with <a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Swamp_Giant" title="Swamp Giant">Swamp Giant</a> falling from a great height. They are both gripping onto the giant.</i>]

<b>Swamp Giant</b>:  AAAAH!

<b>Finn</b>:  Last chance, Swamp Giant! Tell us where you hid the <a href="/wiki/Mini_Queen" title="Mini Queen">Mini Queen</a>!

<b>Swamp Giant</b>:  NEVER!!

[<i>The three scream as they fall. Squeaking is heard.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh? [<i>He finds the Mini Queen.</i>] Hi, Mini Queen! Jake! I've got 'er!

<b>Jake</b>:  Then hold my hand, dude! [<i>Finn does so.</i>] Whoooop!

[<i>Jake inflates, making himself and Finn reach terminal velocity sooner and float gently to the ground.</i>]

<b>Swamp Giant</b>:  Aaaah! Oof!

[<i>The swamp giant hits the ground. Finn and Jake land on the flattened giant. Jake lets his air out and deflates.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  My inflatable angel.

<b>Jake</b>:  Heh heh heh. [<i>They jump off the giant.</i>] How's the Mini Queen?

<b>Finn</b>:  I dunno. Can't understand a word she says. [<i>The Mini Queen promptly writes a message on Finn's hand that says, "THANK YOU 4 SAVING ME, XOXO CALL ME." The Mini Queen shapes her antennae to look like a heart.</i>] Aww! My pleasure, ma'am! I just like beating up evil! [<i>Finn performs a "handshake" with one of her antennae. She squeaks.</i>] Okay... Didn't... catch any of that either.

[<i>The Mini Queen jumps on Jake's nose and then leaps away.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Sniffs</i>] Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky. [Sniffs] No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way! [<i>He sniffs the ground and follows a scent. The scent leads him to a <a href="/wiki/Nothung" title="Nothung">sword</a>.</i>] Whoa!

<b>Finn</b>:  What?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>In awe</i>] Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy!

<b>Finn</b>:  <a href="/wiki/Billy" title="Billy">Billy</a>?!

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  [<i>Singing</i>] BIIILLYYYYYY!!!

[<i>Flashback</i>]

<b>Young Billy</b>:  Nothung!

[<i>The sword comes to Billy and sparks lightning dramatically. The musical sequence begins.</i>]

[<i>Back in the present</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, yeah! That was the most mathematical thing ever!

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear!

<b>Finn</b>:  This is so cool!

[<i>He attempts to pull out the sword. The ground cracks and makes a hole in the side of the mountain appear.</i>]

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  Whoa!

<b>Finn</b>:  It's Billy's legendary crack!

[<i>They go inside. They gasp as they are treated with Billy's presence.</i>]

<b>Billy</b>:  [<i>Sighs</i>] Hello.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Whispering to Jake</i>] It's him! It's him!!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Whispering</i>] I know, I know! Be cool!!

<b>Billy</b>:  Yep. It's me.

<b>Finn</b>:  Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices!

<b>Billy</b>:  What for?

<b>Finn</b>:  So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you!

<b>Jake</b>:  I wanna be the dog version of you!

<b>Billy</b>:  Ahh, that'd be a waste of time.

<b>Jake</b>:  Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups!

<b>Billy</b>:  No, I was talking about beating up monsters. It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail.

<b>Jake</b>:  Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch! [<i>He tries to catch his tail, of course to no avail.</i>] Ah... ah...

<b>Finn</b>:  What do you mean, "pointless?" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!

<b>Billy</b>:  You know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead. [<i>Finn gasps.</i>] In my youth, I was much like you. Motivated. Headstrong. Wore a silly, little outfit. Even had a magic dog.

[<i>Billy points to his <a href="/wiki/Dogs#Billy.27s_Dog" title="Dogs">skeleton of a dog</a>.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Scared, yet smiling</i>] Heh... I'm gonna pass out... [<i>Falls backward</i>]

<b>Billy</b>:  All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures. [<i>Deep sigh</i>] But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort!

<b>Jake</b>:  What other way is there?

<b>Billy</b>:  Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community.

<b>Finn</b>:  Nonviolently?? [<i>Sighs</i>] I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way...

<b>Jake</b>:  Me, too!

<b>Finn</b>:  Billy, I won't let you down!

<b>Jake</b>:  I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy!

[<i>They run away screaming. Billy sighs wearily. The scene shifts to the Grass Lands. Finn is riding on Jake.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  This is gonna be tough, Jake. I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct.

<b>Jake</b>:  Relax. It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people.

<b>Cobbler</b>:  Help! Help! [<i>Finn and Jake notice his cries.</i>] A monster! [<i>The cobbler runs into Jake's leg. Jake retracts.</i>] Oh! Thank goodness! Heroes! I'm being chased by a horrible <a href="/wiki/Dragons" title="Dragons">Dragon</a>! Please, please help!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, uh...

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh...

<b>Cobbler</b>:  Act quickly! He's almost upon us!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Straightforward</i>] Sorry. We don't beat stuff up anymore.

<b>Cobbler</b>:  No, but please! [<i>Stammers frantically</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To Jake</i>] Dude. We gotta do something to help him.

<b>Jake</b>:  I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To cobbler</i>] Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?

<b>Cobbler</b>:  Well... I've been running all day. I guess I'm pretty hungry.

<b>Jake</b>:  Say no more. [<i>Walking away, pulling Finn with him</i>] Come on, Finn.

<b>Cobbler</b>:  Where're you going?!

<b>Jake</b>:  To make you somethin' to eat!

[<i>They leave. The dragon arrives.</i>]

<b>Cobbler</b>:  AAAH!! NO!! HELP!!

[<i>The dragon attacks him by breathing fire. The scene transitions to a town where Finn and Jake are running a food stand.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon.

<b>Jake</b>:  Trust me. This is a way better way to help 'im. [<i>Yelling out</i>] Gruel! Get your free gruel!

<b>Lady</b>:  [<i>Walking up to stand</i>] What's this all about?

<b>Finn</b>:  Free gruel, ma'am. I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure!

<b>Lady</b>:  Hahaha! [<i>Eats gruel</i>] I didn't throw up! This gruel is very adequate.

<b>Finn</b>:  [Victoriously] YEAH!!!

[Cut to the other townspeople eating Finn and Jake's gruel.]

<b>Finn</b>:  This is great, Jake!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, we're really helpin' people!

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa! Look who it is!

[<i>The cobbler walks up to Finn and Jake. There are scorch marks on him.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude! You're alive!

<b>Cobbler</b>:  [<i>Angrily</i>] No thanks to you two!! That dragon chased me for two days!! ...And then I was lost for... uh, three days... and then I... I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for... [<i>Unsure</i>] a week? So that's two, plus three, plus a week—

[<i>Jake shushes him.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Deliberate</i>] Dude. Gruel.

<b>Cobbler</b>:  Oh, thank you! [<i>Eats it</i>] Hahahaha! Hahaha. [<i>His hand suddenly becomes encased in stone.</i>] AAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh? [<i>Holds up glass with potion in it</i>] Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor.

<b>Cobbler</b>:  Wha? Ah... uh?!

[<i>More of his body becomes encased in stone. The cobbler strikes himself with a fork, and it has no effect. The cobbler panics.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude... how much of that potion did you use?

[<i>Finn holds up five more empty potion bottles. The townspeople have grown armor as well. One of the townspeople's belly button starts shooting flames.</i>]

<b>Townsperson</b>:  AAAAH!! MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE!!!

<b>Finn</b>:  [To Jake] Geez... I thought people would like that.

<b>Cobbler</b>:  Why?! Why would anyone want that?!

<b>Finn</b>:  So you can defend against evil monsters!

<b>Cobbler</b>:  You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!

<b>Finn</b>:  No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently!

<b>Cobbler</b>:  Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Sooo... the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh?

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  [<i>Thinking</i>] Hmmmmmm...

<b>Cobbler</b>:  WHAT?! NO—

[<i>Cut to the shoe-repair shop.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Alright! We're cobblers!

<b>Cobbler</b>:  No, you're not!! You're just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist! [<i>Leaving</i>] And don't try to cobble anything!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To Finn</i>] What does "cobble" mean, anyway?

<b>Finn</b>:  I think it has something to do with shoes...

<b><a href="/wiki/Fine_Lady" title="Fine Lady">Fine Lady</a></b>:  [<i>Entering shop</i>] Excuse me! Can you help me? I need a broken heel fixed. I'm going to a fancy funeral.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Taking shoe and heel</i>] Of course I'll help!

[<i>Scene transition. Finn is hammering in the heel.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  There! [<i>Rolling over to lady</i>] Whah! [<i>He puts the shoe on her foot.</i>] Pa-kow!!

<b>Fine Lady</b>:  Ah!

[<i>She seems content with the repair. Suddenly, a blade comes out of the shoe. The lady makes a small gasp.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To Finn</i>] Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail?

<b>Finn</b>:  Maybe... [<i>The shoe arms axes, an extra blade, and a lasso.</i>] Whoa!

<b>Jake</b>:  Cool!

<b>Fine Lady</b>:  I cannot go to the funeral in these!

<b>Cobbler</b>:  [<i>Entering shop</i>] Hey, everyone! I'm back from the doctor! [<i>The lady's shoe lace lasso's the cobbler.</i>] WHY?! [<i>The lace forces the cobbler to the ground.</i>]

<b>Fine Lady</b>:  [<i>To Finn and Jake</i>] ...And I'm not supposed to bring a guest.

<b>Cobbler</b>:  [<i>To Finn and Jake</i>] GET OUT!!

[<i>Cut to outside the shop.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent.

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're "sucking" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Frustrated sigh</i>] Totes. I'll stop "pooping" my diaper.

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa, what?!

<b>Townsperson with fire-spitting belly button</b>:  HELP! I NEED MEDICAL HELP!!

<b>Finn</b>:  Medical help? Hmmmmm...

[<i>The scene shifts to the hospital where Finn and Jake are doctors.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  How can we help?

<b><a href="/wiki/Lumpy_Space_Princess" title="Lumpy Space Princess">Lumpy Space Princess</a></b>:  I want surgery to make my body hot.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yikes...

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Yeah. I know I'm already pretty smokin'... but I bought this swimsuit, so I need a swimsuit body.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Whistles</i>] [<i>To Finn</i>] You up for some serious plastic surgery?

[<i>The Adventure Time logo swirls onto the screen.</i>]

[<i>Lumpy Space Princess comes out of the hospital with a new body, complete with legs.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Aw, yeah! This body's hot! And powerful! [<i>Suddenly, machine parts form on her body like a cyborg.</i>] Huh?! Aw, what?! [<i>Her legs turns into a wheel. She makes pained noises.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude, did you use a magic nail again?

<b>Finn</b>:  I've got three left!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Ohhhh... [<i>She gains a robotic eye.</i>] What did you do to me??

<b>Finn</b>:  We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  No one thinks this look is hot!!

[<i>The cobbler suddenly walks up.</i>]

<b>Cobbler</b>:  [<i>To Lumpy Space Princess</i>] Oh, my laces! You're the most beautiful— [<i>He suddenly gets shot with a laser from her robotic eye.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Huh?!

[<i>Her wheel activates, and she speeds into the cobbler. The townsperson with the flame-shooting belly button runs by again screaming.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  ...Jake...?

<b>Jake</b>:  ....Yeah...?

<b>Finn</b>:  I think us being nonviolent... is hurting people. Man... Billy is gonna be so bummed out...

<b>Jake</b>:  Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive!

<b>Finn</b>:  I just wanna sit here and moan.

<b>Jake</b>:  Then I'll moan with ya, buddy.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Moaning</i>] Thaaaanks, buuuddy...

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Moaning</i>] Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome...

[Finn and Jake notice more cries for help.]

<b><a href="/wiki/Old_Lady_(His_Hero)" title="Old Lady (His Hero)">Old Lady</a></b>:  AAAH! AAAH! HELP ME!!

<b>Swamp Giant</b>:  Hahaha! Relax! I'm just gonna grind you up!!

<b>Old Lady</b>:  AAAH! AAAH!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To Finn</i>] Aw, man, this grass-bag again?? [<i>Heroically</i>] HEY, EVIL-DOER! [<i>Weakly</i>] Um... could you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here.

<b>Swamp Giant</b>:  It's not evil!! When they get this old, they <i>wanna</i> be ground up!! Hahaha! Right, you old bat?!

<b>Old Lady</b>:  Help!!

[<i>Finn sweats.</i>]

<b>Swamp Giant</b>:  Right?!?

[<i>Finn strains, visibly in conflict.</i>]

<b>Old Lady</b>:  Oooh!! Aaah!!

[<i>Finn raises his fist.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh?? A fist raised in righteous anger?! Oh, no! It's my fist!! I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!! Hmmm...

<b>Swamp Giant</b>:  [<i>To Old Lady</i>] Yeah, you wanna get ground up, right?!?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Furiously</i>] WRONG!!!! [<i>He punches and uppercuts the Swamp Giant, saving the Old Lady.</i>] [<i>Quietly, to Jake</i>] I couldn't think of anything...

<b>Old Lady</b>:  Whooo! [<i>Falls in Finn's and Jake's arms</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  POOP!! I saved her with violence...

<b>Old Lady</b>:  What's your huff, son?

<b>Finn</b>:  The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent... and I promised I would do that and not let him down... but I did let 'im down.

<b>Old Lady</b>:  Stuff and nonsense! You sure helped this old gal out! And you did it with violence! Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures! [<i>Punches Finn</i>] Just like I was born to be an old lady! Don't deny your rowdy nature, paladins! [<i>Starts dancing</i>] And don't take advice from old people! [<i>Continues dancing</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah... Yeah...! YEAH!! That old lady has a point!

<b>Jake</b>:  Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo—

<b>Finn</b>:  It's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy!!

<b>Jake</b>:  Cha!!

[<i>Scene transition to Billy's cave.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  It's us again.

<b>Jake</b>:  And we've got exciting news!

<b>Billy</b>:  Aw, I don't—I don't wanna buy anything.

<b>Finn</b>:  Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old. Also, that I should do what I was born to do... which is kickin' buns.

<b>Billy</b>:  Don't you see how pointless it is? You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now? She's probably dead!

<b>Jake</b>:  She's right here. [<i>Turns around, revealing her</i>]

<b>Old Lady</b>:  Hello!

[<i>Billy gasps.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  We saved 'er, Billy.

<b>Jake</b>:  You saved 'er.

<b>Finn</b>:  I saved 'er, Billy. I saved 'er using violence. And that's not a bad thing, Billy! This old lady is alive because of these! [<i>Holds up fists and leg</i>] And look how happy she is, man! She's elated!

<b>Billy</b>:  Hmm. Perhaps you're right. [<i>Pained groan</i>] It's... it's as if your words are filling a void in my very being... You wanna watch? [<i>He reveals a literal void in his stomach. Finn and Jake gasp. The hole starts filling up with body mass.</i>] Nothung! [<i>The sword comes back once again.</i>] Finn and Jake... truly, you are my heroes. [<i>They laugh excitedly.</i>] Now you're freakin' me out... [<i>Finn, Jake, and the old lady climb on Billy enthusiastically. Finn and Jake are taken off.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  We're his heroes!!

[<i>Billy looks at the old lady.</i>]

<b>Billy</b>:  Huh... Hello.

<b>Jake</b>:  Ha! Haha! I love you, Billy!!

<b>Billy</b>:  Get outta here!!

[<i>Finn and Jake run out quickly, laughing heartily. As Finn and Jake happily wander off, Billy nods contentedly. The episode comes to a close.</i>]
