[<i><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a> observes <a href="/wiki/Ice_King%27s_Castle" title="Ice King's Castle" class="mw-redirect">Ice King's Castle</a> through binoculars.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hour ​​six of our <a href="/wiki/Ice_Kingdom" title="Ice Kingdom">Ice Kingdom</a> stakeout. Abso-nothing's going on there.

<b><a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></b>: [<i>Reading a <a href="/wiki/Ninja_manual" title="Ninja manual" class="mw-redirect">ninja manual</a></i>] And if I do this hand position, [<i>he positions his hand</i>] my boogers should turn into smoke bombs.

<b>Finn</b>: Pfff. You sure this tip is good, <a href="/wiki/Flambo" title="Flambo">Flambo</a>?

<b>Fambo</b>: [<i>surrounded by logs like a campfire</i>] Come on, you know I'm on the level. The <a href="/wiki/Ice_King" title="Ice King">Ice King</a> is scheming to nabs a princess today. I swears it.

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm.

<b>Jake</b>: Relax, Restless Pants. A true ninja can sense the intentions of his enemies. [<i>He shifts his ears into a symbol</i>] Jin.

<b>Flambo</b>: [<i>Laughs</i>] Ninjas? Ninjas ain't real for nothing, no how.

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa, now—ninjas <i>are</i> real. For you see, [<i>covers his mouth with his sweater</i>] Doo, doo, doo... Jake and I <i>are</i> ninjas.

<b>Jake</b>: Yep, ever since we fished this ninja manual out of a ditch. Finn, booty me!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Jake throws the booties and Jake catches them on his feet</i>] Listen!

[<i><a href="/wiki/Penguins" title="Penguins">Penguin</a> sounds are heard</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Finn, I think I'm gonna take off my booties. I can't flip these pages.

<b>Ice King</b>: <a href="/wiki/Gunter" title="Gunter">Gunter</a>, let's go! I've got the overnight bag.

<b>Gunter</b>: Wenk, wenk!

<b>Finn</b>: It's the Ice King, all right, and he's looking awful pleased with himself.

<b>Jake</b>: Uh-oh. If the Ice King's so happy, he must have stolen a princess when we weren't looking, somehow. [<i>covers his mouth with his ears</i>] That's ninja logic.

<b>Finn</b>: Then we gotta...

<b>Flambo</b>: [<i>Interrupts</i>] Ahem.

[<i>Finn gives a charcoal Flambo.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: ...we gotta save that princess.

<b>Jake</b>: You got it, shino-bro! Ninja kick!

<b>Finn</b>: Ninja kick!

[<i>They jump away and enter the Ice King's castle.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Princess? Princess!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Sniffs the floor and raises an armchair with his arm like a jack</i>] Princess?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Looking in the jail</i>] Princess!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Looking in the toilet</i>] Princess? ...Ahh...

[<i>They regroup.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: No princess here, man.

<b>Finn</b>: No princess? [<i>Gasps</i>] It's... a trap! We're being trapped! Ninja vanish! Evade! Evade!

<b>Jake</b>: Nothing is trapped, dude. We can't find any captured princesses, because the Ice King hasn't captured one yet. He's out doin' it right now.

<b>Finn</b>: Are you sure?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>confident</i>] No. It's only a ninja hunch, so we should ninja snoop for proof.

[<i>They go to the Ice King's bedroom.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Wait, man. I-I feel uncomfortable snooping through Ice King's personal stuff. It feels sorta like... [<i>darkly</i>] a violation.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Pulls out a book from under a pillow on the bed</i>] Whoo! Got the <a href="/wiki/Ice_King%27s_diary" title="Ice King's diary">Ice King's diary</a>.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>shakes his head</i>] No, no, no, no, no! We can't read his private junk! [<i>Tries to stop Jake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: And yet we must. [<i>clears his throat and takes the form of the Ice King</i>] Dear diary—and you better write me back this time!— [<i>not actually reading</i>] today I'm bringing home a special new cutie.

<b>Finn</b>: There's our proof, man! ... Hmm, alright. Let's use our ninja stealth and hide until he comes back with the princess.

[<i>Jake shrinks.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Or... we could keep looking through his stuff. Heh, heh, heh! You know, for more proof? Hehehe!

<b>Finn</b>: No. [<i>Stops Jake</i>] Alls we're gonna do is lie in wait until the Ice King gets back. Then—BOOM [<i>pokes Jake</i>]—we catch him with princess on his hands. [<i>Starts playing with Jake like a plane</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Where are we gonna hide?

<b>Finn</b>: In this filthy hamper! [<i>He tosses Jake in the basket and then jumps in after him.</i>] Think he's there yet?

[<i>Jake goes to see.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: See anything?

<b>Jake</b>: Nah. Hey, Finn, I don't want to hide in the hamper anymore; it reeks in here.

<b>Finn</b>: But we're ninjas! And this is our ninja hideout.

<b>Jake</b>: Nah, man. My sense of smell is, like, one thousand times better than yours. Also, the hamper's boring. I'm out.

<b>Finn</b>: Wait!

[<i>Jake leaves the basket.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: I'm out!

<b>Finn</b>: Jake! Get back here! [<i>Throws a meatball at him, which hits <a href="/wiki/Ice_King%27s_computer" title="Ice King's computer">Ice King's computer</a></i>] [<i>Jake goes to the computer.</i>] Hey, wait up!

<b>Jake</b>: Check this out!

[<i>They both look the Ice King's drawings on the computer and laugh.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Weird.

<b>Jake</b>: I want to draw something.

<b>Finn</b>: Hey! [<i>Try to stop Jake</i>] We gotta leave no trace! Ninjas leave no trace!

<b>Jake</b>: I'll delete it after!

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, come on!

[<i>They laugh and Finn accidentally pushes the computer table. It slides across the floor and crashes into a glass wall, shattering it.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>gasps</i>] Jake, what have we done?

<b>Both</b>: [<i>gasp</i>] A secret hidden room full of ninja stuff!

[<i>The scene changes to the Ice King laughing and flying to a Rock Hospital.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: [<i>Entering the hospital</i>] Oh, great—a line. [<i>starts to freeze the people in front of him</i>] Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.

<b>Rock Man</b>: Uhh, I-I think you were actually ahead of me.

<b>Ice King</b>: [<i>Freezes Rock Man</i>] You know I was. [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>Approaches to management</i>] Counter maid, I demand medical attentions, [<i>softens his voice</i>] preferably those of a princessy type.

<b><a href="/wiki/Rock_Nurse" title="Rock Nurse">Rock Nurse</a></b>: And are you checking in as a patient or a cadaver?

<b>Ice King</b>: Hey! I'm as healthy as ten old men!

[<i>Gunter complains weakly.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Ah! Oh, oh, right! [<i>Puts Gunter on the counter</i>] My penguin—he's very, very sick. So... what time does your shift end?

[<i>The scene switches to Jake walking down stairs.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: What kind of guy builds a cave inside of another a cave? [<i>Goes to a book</i>] What's this? A spellbook? [<i>Turns the pedestal</i>] Whoo!

<b>Finn</b>: Dude! Leave no trace!

<b>Jake</b>: Ah, it's too late for that.

<b>Finn</b>: It's not too [<i>Stops the pedestal</i>] ...late. WHOA!

<b>Jake</b>: What'cha got there?

<b>Finn</b>: Dude! It's a <a href="/wiki/Ninjas_of_the_Ice:_The_Art_of_Fridjitzu" title="Ninjas of the Ice: The Art of Fridjitzu">first-edition Ice Ninja Manual</a>!

[<i>Jake gasps deeply.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>reading the manual</i>] A true ninja passes no wind; he only passes... [<i>Jake farts in Finn's face, cutting him off. Finn wipes his face in disgust.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>in the manual</i>] I ain't even heard of these techniques. [<i>He makes a symbol with his hand</i>] Nuh-nuh-n-numm-nuh [<i>Summons ice nunchucks on his hand.</i>] numb-chucks.

<b>Finn</b>: Hey. Ice King seems way into ninjas, even more than we are.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Twirling the nunchucks</i>] Yeah, so? [<i>He hits himself with the nunchucks.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: So... doesn't that mean that ninjas must be... kinda lame?

<b>Jake</b>: Nah, they're still cool. But Ice King's still lame because he hides his ninja love. We wear our ninja on our sleeves! [<i>Breaks a cabinet with nunchucks</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Jake! Show me how to do that.

[<i>The scene changes to Gunter and Ice King waiting in a hospital ward.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: What's taking that doctor so long? Gunter, make more noise!

<b>Gunter</b>: WUAH! WUAH!

<b>Ice King</b>: Yeah, alright. Don't oversell it, drama queen.

[<i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Princess" title="Doctor Princess">Doctor Princess</a> enters the room.</i>]

<b>Dr. Princess</b>: Dun, dun, dunnn. Pardon the intrusion. I'm Doctor Princess.

<b>Ice King</b>: Yes, well, uh... [<i>quietly</i>] Come to Ice King, Princess.

<b>Dr. Princess</b>: [<i>Approaching Gunter</i>] Don't worry, sir. I specialize in treating little tuxedo people.

<b>Ice King</b>: Just give it to me straight, doc. Am I gonna have to pay for this?

<b>Dr. Princess</b>: [<i>Puts her stethoscope in Gunter's face</i>] Hmm...

<b>Gunter</b>: [<i>like a heartbeat</i>] Wenk-wenk. Wenk-wenk. Wenk-wenk.

<b>Dr. Princess</b>: Oh, my!

<b>Ice King</b>: What can you do for him, Doctor Princess? [<i>He takes off his crown.</i>] Without Gunter, I'll be all alone. You see, I'm a widower.

<b>Dr. Princess</b>: Oh, I'm sorry. How did your wife die? [<i>Gunter begins to inflate.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Oh, what? Is that what that means? [<i>Puts his crown back on</i>]

<b>Dr. Princess</b>: Whoa, Nelly! Something medical is happening!

[<i>Gunter inflates even more.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Gunter, you're embarrassing me!

[<i>The scene changes to Finn and Jake practicing ninja techniques.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Making hand positions</i>] Fridjitsu master Finn summons... dagger of chilled glass. [<i>Does so</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Also making hand positions</i>] Fridjitsu master Jake summons... stars of frozen rain. [<i>Does so</i>] Get ready to be... star struck. [<i>Throws the stars at Finn</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Get ready to be... cold cut!

[<i>They fight. Finn breaks a TV and a seat. Jake breaks his dagger. They leave the room.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hyah!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>takes two <a href="/wiki/Throwing_knives" title="Throwing knives">kunai</a> from a case and throws them</i>] Kunai attack!

[<i>The kunai break loose some icicles from the ceiling.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Kicks icicles</i>] Icicle kick!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Makes hand positions and counterattacks with snow</i>] Force of blizzard!

[<i>The avalanche breaks the Ice King's chair.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Evades the snow with a jump</i>] Flying jump!

[<i>Jake brings up three clones of himself</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What?! Three Jakes? That's one too many. Caltrop hailstorm! [<i>Summons ice stars and throws them toward the Jakes, which disappear</i>] Those Jakes were all fakes!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Behind Finn</i>] Heh! Fridjitsu master Jake summons... arrow of ice! [<i>He does so and fires it at Finn, using his arm as a bow.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hiyah! [<i>Finn catches the arrow and breaks it on the floor.</i>] Rad.

[<i>Jake's eyes glow and sparkle</i>] Ahh...

<b>Both</b>: [<i>dancing</i>] WOOHOO! YEAH!

[<i>They hear whistling from outside.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: It's the Ice King! Hide!

<b>Ice King</b>: [<i>hums</i>] Okay, m'dear, this enclosure will be your new home!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>To Jake</i>] [<i>whispering</i>] He's got a princess. Now we leap out and catch him red-handed. [<i>He and Jake cover their mouths.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hai!

<b>Finn</b>: Snow blind! [<i>Disappears in a flurry of snow</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Thin ice, thin ice, thin ice! [<i>Turns 2D and disappears</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: ...but once you get used to the smell of penguin manure, it's almost tolerable.

[<i>Finn and Jake jump through the air wielding ice ninja weapons.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Ice King, hand over that princess!

<b>Ice King</b>: Princess? What?

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, where's the princess?

<b>Jake</b>: Ooh, right.

<b>Ice King</b>: What princess?

<b>Finn</b>: The, um... princess you were just talking to?

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, the one you just came back from <i>stealin'.</i>

<b>Ice King</b>: Wrong-o. I was at the hospital, for it turns out Gunter here was preggers!

[<i>Gunter shows his egg.</i>]

<b>Gunter</b>: Wenk.

<b>Ice King</b>: I was just talking to the egg! It's such a cutie!

<b>Jake</b>: Gunther's a woman?!

<b>Ice King</b>: What? No! [<i>Checks under Gunter, then throws him aside</i>] Fuh. Anyway, get out of my house or I'll kill you, et cetera. I want to take a nap in my easy chair. [<i>suddenly gasps</i>] What happened to my recliner?!

<b>Finn</b>: Ohh...

<b>Ice King</b>: My skins and tubs!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>inhales through his teeth</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: You even violated my secret sanctum?! What is wrong with you?!

<b>Finn</b>: No princess?

<b>Ice King</b>: No! No princess!

[<i>Finn and Jake's weapons disappear.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: We messed up, Jake. We're... violators!

<b>Ice King</b>: Yeah, what the heck?! You think you can just wreck my house and wear my collectibles?! [<i>He removes their headbands and throws them on the floor</i>] Hah! Who do you guys think you are?!

<b>Finn</b>: We're... ninjas?

<b>Ice King</b>: You're not ninjas! You're just a couple of jerks!

[<i>Finn and Jake fall to the ground.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: It's true. [<i>Rises</i>] Ice King, we're gonna make this right.

<b>Ice King</b>: Yeah, do it; make it right. And start by, uh... oh, take my bag over to the cage.

[<i>Finn takes the bag and Ice King laughs. Then muffled noises are heard from the bag and Finn realizes.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Oh, no, no, no! Not that! Never mind! Put that down and go clean my gym equipment.

[<i>Finn opens the bag and out comes Doctor Princess.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Doctor Princess!

<b>Ice King</b>: [<i>Nervously</i>] Oh, heh... I have no idea how <i>that</i> got in there!

<b>Finn</b>: What's goin' on?

<b>Dr. Princess</b>: I'll field that one. [<i>Cleans her lenses</i>] The Ice King abducted me while I was distracted by the horrifying beauty of birth.

[<i>Gunter rubs the egg on his face.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Yes, Gunter's ailment was the perfect cover for stealing a princess, M.D.

<b>Dr. Princess</b>: I'm not even a real princess. "Princess" is just a surname. [<i>Jake helps her out of the bag.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Enough! You may have uncovered my princess-smuggling scheme, but you'll never leave this place <i>alive</i>!

[<i>Hits his palm with his fist.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] A couple of ninjas like me and Finn can only be defeated by another ninja!

[<i>The Ice King wraps his beard around his head.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Doot, doo, doooo! [<i>summons an ice sansetsukon</i>] Ninja!

<b>Finn and Jake</b>: Ninja! [<i>They cover their mouths and brandish ice weapons.</i>]

<b>Dr. Princess</b>: What am I... looking at here, exactly?

<b>Finn, Jake and the Ice King</b>: NINJA! [<i>They start to fight.</i>]

<b>Dr. Princess</b>: [<i>To Gunter</i>] So... how is your egg doing?

<b>Gunter</b>: Wenk, wenk.

<b>Dr. Princess</b>: Oh.

[<i>Gunter gets onto the egg and it begins to crack. From it comes a kitten.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: [<i>realizes</i>] Gunter! Why didn't you tell me?

<b>Gunter</b>: [<i>shrugs</i>] [<i>like "I don't know"</i>] Weh-weh-wenk.

<b>Ice King</b>: Oh, Gunter...

[<i>Finn and Jake kick Ice King in the face and back, respectively. Then a closing a banner appears.</i>]
