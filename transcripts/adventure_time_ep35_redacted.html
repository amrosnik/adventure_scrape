[<i>The episode starts off in a forest with <a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a> feeding baby birds in a nest by chewing an apple first; the birds are chirping.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Blah-la-luh. Hey, <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a>, give me some of that apple.

<b>Jake</b>:  Coming up. [<i>Jake does a wave with his left arm then stretches his right arm up to Finn handing him the apple. Finn starts chewing the apple.</i>] I know what <i>you're</i> thinking about.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Muffled because of the apple in his mouth</i>] Huh?

<b>Jake</b>:  Kissin' Princess Bubblegum on the mouth!

[<i>Finn spits the chewed-up apple to the baby birds.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Spits and with nervousness in his voice</i>] No, I'm not! And... I wouldn't even do that ever.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, you would. You're just bad at talking to ladies.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmmph. [<i>Continues feeding birds</i>] Ehggg-uh-ya-uh. Uh, should I keep going, <a href="/wiki/Mrs._Yoder" title="Mrs. Yoder">Mrs. Yoder</a>?

<b>Mrs. Yoder</b>:  [<i>The mother bird's upper beak was bound up</i>] No, Finn, that's plenty. Thank you.

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay. [<i>Throws away apple</i>] Let us know if you need anything else. Hyah!

<b>Mrs. Yoder</b>:  You two are heroes!

[<i>Finn jumps off the tree and spins around a branch to land swiftly on the ground.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Landing</i>] Hunh.

<b>Jake</b>:  Come on, dude.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey! Do you hear that? She called us heroes!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Chuckles</i>] Yeah, I heard.

[<i>A bush starts rustling; Finn and Jake both spot the moving bush and look shocked.</i>]

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  Huh?

[<i>The <a href="/wiki/Tree_Witch" title="Tree Witch">Tree Witch</a> pops out of the bush.</i>]

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Hey! How's it going?! [<i>Brushes the bush off her dress.</i>] Ugh! Is that true, what the bird said? You guys are heroes?

<b>Finn</b>:  Why were you hiding in that shrub?

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Oh, I wasn't hiding. I'm a Tree Witch. I can turn into trees and shrubs and bushes and stuff. Check it out.

[<i>She holds out her arms and they grow into mini trees. She then turns them back to normal.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Bored</i>] Bleh.

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  So listen, I need you two heroes to get me a lock of princess hair. [<i>Scratches armpit then sniffs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Why do you need princess hair?

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Why? 'Cause I have a balding problem! What, are you, <i>blind</i>? [<i>Pats bald head</i>] [<i>Louder</i>] Are You <i>blind</i>!?

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  No, we're not blind. [<i>They nervously talk over each other.</i>] I had no idea... I don't know...

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Anyway, I need the princess hair so I can put it on my head. [<i>Sticks her head out</i>] And then I'll be beautiful.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, well, uh, we know <i>lots</i> of princesses.

[<i>Jake stops him from talking and laughs nervously.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To the Tree Witch</i>] Uh, can you, um, give us a minute?

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Yeah, okay.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Whispering to Finn</i>] Dude, I don't think we should help her.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Whispering</i>] Why not?

<b>Jake</b>:  'Cause she's a witch!

<b>Finn</b>:  Maybe she's a <i>good</i> witch.

<b>Jake</b>:  Her? Are you kidding? Come on, look at her! [<i>She turns her finger into a Venus fly trap and it swallows a butterfly.</i>] If she was good, she wouldn't be so ugly.

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Are you guys still talking?!

<b>Finn</b>:  So what do we do? Tell her we can't help her 'cause she's ugly?

<b>Jake</b>:  No, man! She'll kill us or put a freaky curse on us or something. [<i>Glances at her</i>] Let <i>me</i> get rid of her with some of my world-famous <i>smoove</i> talking. [<i>He walks over to the Tree Witch.</i>] [<i>Smooth talking with romantic music in the background</i>] Hey. Sorry about that, girl. [<i>Lies down</i>] Ahh. You don't mind if I take a load off, do you?

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  What were you guys talking about?

<b>Jake</b>:  How pretty you are.

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Huh?

<b>Jake</b>:  We were just saying someone as pretty as you doesn't even <i>need</i> a full head of hair. [<i>Finn bends down next to him.</i>] Isn't that right, buddy?

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh, yeah, totally!

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Nuh-unh! [<i>Giggles</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Girl, if I didn't already have a G.F., I'd be on you like butter on toast!

[<i>Tree Witch lies down on ground next to Jake.</i>]

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  [<i>Seductively</i>] I don't mind if you have a G.F.

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh. Umm…

<b>Finn</b>:  Dude, I don't think it's working.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, I think I'm making things worse.

[<i>Tree Witch touches Jake's leg.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Ah-ah-ahhh!

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Hey.

<b>Jake</b>:  What?

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  How would you... court me?

<b>Jake</b>:  Um... spaghetti dinner?

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Hmm.

<b>Finn</b>:  Look, Lady, we can't help you get princess hair.

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Why not?

<b>Finn</b>:  Because... we only help when someone's in danger. [<i>Jake smiles at Finn's logic.</i>]

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Oh! Well, why didn't you say so?

[<i>The Tree Witch stands up and clears her throat. She grunts and uses magical powers to pick up Jake.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey... uh... what's—?! Yaaah! Hey!

[<i>She places him on the ground then sits on him.</i>]

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  There. <i>Now</i> someone's in danger.

<b>Jake</b>:  I <i>told</i> you she was evil!

<b>Finn</b>:  Grrrrrr.... Yaah!

[<i>Finn gets angry and charges at the Tree Witch. He jumps to attack her, but she deflects him with a force field.</i>]

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  What, you forget I'm a witch?

<b>Finn</b>:  Maybe.

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Well, <i>maybe</i> you should get me some princess hair, so <i>maybe</i> your friend doesn't get sucked into my bottomless bottom!

[<i>Jake starts getting pulled into her bottom.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Nyuh! Get some princess hair!!

<b>Finn</b>:  All right, fine! [<i>Starts to leave</i>]

<b>Tree Witch'</b>:  Wait! Uh, you... you can't tell anyone why you need it.

<b>Finn</b>:  What? Why?

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  I don't want anyone to know I have a balding problem.

<b>Finn</b>:  O...kay. [<i>Walks away</i>]

[<i>Scene changes to show Finn looking at <a href="/wiki/Muscle_Princess%27s_castle" title="Muscle Princess's castle">castle</a>.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  It's <a href="/wiki/Muscle_Princess" title="Muscle Princess">Princess Muscles</a>'s castle! [<i>Runs to door and knocks</i>]

[<i>Muscle Princess picks up the door from the inside and throws it away.</i>]

<b>Muscle Princess</b>:  Hi, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh, hey, Princess Muscles.

<b>Muscle Princess</b>:  What brings you by?

<b>Finn</b>:  Um, you were the nearest princess, and I need a lock of your hair.

[<i>Muscle Princess looks away and blushes.</i>]

<b>Muscle Princess</b>:  I understand.

<b>Finn</b>:  You do?

<b>Muscle Princess</b>:  Mm-hmm. [<i>Starts to hug Finn</i>]

[<i>Finn screams and falls through her arms onto the ground.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Aah! What are you doing?

<b>Muscle Princess</b>:  Trying to give you a hug.

<b>Finn</b>:  Why? I want hair, not hug!

<b>Muscle Princess</b>:  Oh, I see. You want to take things slo-o-o-w.

<b>Finn</b>:  No! I--I'm here to save you! From your hair! It looks really bad. Cut it off, quick!

<b>Muscle Princess</b>:  Of <i>course</i> it looks bad. If I had beautiful, shiny hair, no one would look at my muscles. [<i>Starts punching Finn around</i>] Come back when you wanna get serious about loving me!

[<i>She slams the door back into place. Screen now shows Finn lying on the ground beat up and bruised.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I <i>am</i> terrible at talking to ladies.

[<i>Scene changes to Finn wandering around a forest.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmm... Where's a princess? Princess?... Princess... Princess... Who's that? <i>&#91;<a href="/wiki/Lumpy_Space_Princess" title="Lumpy Space Princess">Lumpy Space Princess</a> is sleeping at a hobo camp.</i>] It's Lumpy Space Princess. [<i>Finn looks around confused at the trash he sees around her.</i>] Does she... live in the <i>woods</i> now?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Sleep-talking</i>] G-G-Get away from my camp! I'll cut you! Hrm. I'm never gonna go back home.

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh. Wait. Does she even have hair? [<i>Finn gets really close to Lumpy Space Princess, the wind blowing and revealing her body covered in very short purple hair.</i>] She <i>does</i>! Well... hair is hair.

[<i>He pulls out a pair of scissors. Lumpy Space Princess wakes up in the middle of him clipping her hair.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh, my Glob! What the stuff are you <i>doing</i>?! Why are you cutting my lumps?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Because they're, uh... So--

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] I knew you liked me.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, I don't! I-I'm just stopping by because--

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Just admit it, Lover Boy! You can't resist me! Well, if you want these lumps, you gotta put a ring on it! Where's my ring?! [<i>Finn does a high-pitch scream and runs away.</i>] I knew you liked me, Finn. That's why you're running! Get in touch with your feelings, babe!

[<i>Finn is now running through a dark, ominous graveyard.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What am I gonna do? Huh? A graveyard? Yes! There's got to be a hairy princess in there that won't think I'm hitting on her![<i>Finn goes around all the tombstones.</i>] Princess? Princess? Princess? Ugh! Come on! Bingo! [<i>He stops at a grave stone and starts reading what it says.</i>] "Here lies Princess Beautiful. She was so beautiful." Hey, that's perfect! And sort of macabre. Oh, well. [<i>Finn starts digging up the grave.</i>] Aha! [<i>He reaches the casket and opens it.</i>]

<b>Princess Beautiful</b>:  Hi, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>:  Ohh!

[<i>Finn moves her skull around checking to see if she has any hair.</i>]

<b>Princess Beautiful</b>:  What? What are you -- Please stop.

[<i>Finn climbs out of the hole followed by Princess Beautiful.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Where's her hair?!

<b>Princess Beautiful</b>:  Thanks, Finn. [<i>Leaves</i>]

[<i>Finn pushes away grass from the bottom of the tombstone so he can read the rest of what it says.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  "Here lies Princess Beautiful. She was so beautiful, but died of baldness?!" Dang it!

[<i>Scene shifts to the Tree Witch and Jake, who is even deeper in her bottom.</i>]

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  [<i>Mumbling to herself</i>] I'm gonna look so beautiful... Invited to all the parties.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Arriving</i>] Jake! Jake! I'm sorry, man. Getting princess hair is -- is impossible! They all just think I'm in love with them! Ugh! I can't do it. You're gonna have to spend the rest of your life in this witch's butt.

<b>Jake</b>:  Noooo!

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Eh! Quiet down! I'm daydreaming!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Whispering</i>] Dude, if they think you like them, then use that. Embrace it! Find the <i>least terrible</i> princess you can, play her some music, cook her a meal, <i>smoove</i> talk her until she likes you. And then get the hair!

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait. You mean like go on a date?

<b>Jake</b>:  Marry a princess if you need to! Just get her hair! Aaaah!

[<i>Jake's head gets sucked into her butt.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Muffled</i>] Go get the hair!

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay! Hold on!

[<i>Scene shifts to the <a href="/wiki/Candy_Kingdom" title="Candy Kingdom">Candy Kingdom</a>.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a>!

[<i>Finn is holding an ax, standing in front of Princess Bubblegum, who is watering her plants.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Hi, Finn!

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh... I need you to come with me!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Why? I'm watering right now.

[<i>Finn smacks the water can out of her hand.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Just come on. We don't have much time!

[<i>They enter an open spot in the woods with a pot of boiling water in the middle.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  What is this, Finn?

<b>Finn</b>:  We're gonna have a spaghetti dinner.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Whoa! Really? Where do we sit?

[<i>Finn immediately goes off yelling and chops down a tree.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Um, Finn?

[<i>Finn then chops up the tree even more to creates seats for both of them.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Put your butt here! Hurry!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Oh. [<i>She does.</i>]

[<i>Finn pulls a fancy table cloth from his backpack along with silverware, dishes, and a candle and places it all on the stump. He then turns to a <a href="/wiki/Simon" title="Simon">ladybug</a> with a violin.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, Simon, make it romantic. [<i>He pays him a dollar; Simon starts playing his violin. Finn then goes to the boiling pot of water and pulls the spaghetti out with his bare hands.</i>] Oww! Here, shove this in your mouth! It's hot!

[<i>He drops the spaghetti on the table.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn, I don't understand--

<b>Finn</b>:  Please, Princess! Just stick it in your mouth!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Well, okay. [<i>Fills her mouth with a big spoonful of spaghetti</i>] [<i>Chomping</i>] You're lucky I love spaghetti!

<b>Finn</b>:  Um, Princess... do you like me?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Gasps in surprise</i>] Finn, of course I like you.

<b>Finn</b>:  Really?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Yeah!

<b>Finn</b>:  Yes! Now give me some of your hair!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Oh, Finn, that's sweet. Sure, I'll give you some of my hair. [<i>Tears of a piece of her hair</i>] Here. Take it, you cutie.

[<i>Finn jumps on the table knocking everything off.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Thank you, Princess Bubblegum!! [<i>Quickly runs away</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  My spaghetti!

[<i>Scene shifts back to the Tree Witch sitting on Jake. It is now dawn.</i>]

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  My cat had kittens... and I'm thinking of naming one "Little Whiner." What do you think? Is that a good name?

[<i>Finn appears holding Princess Bubblegum's hair.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Totally did it! Genuine princess hair. You hear that, Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Muffled</i>] Just give it to her, already!!

<b>Finn</b>:  All right, lady, a deal is a deal.

[<i>Finn hands her the hair and she gasps in excitement, but then frowns.</i>]

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Ahh! This isn't hair! It's bubblegum!

<b>Jake</b>:  What?!

[<i>Finn takes the hair back and licks it.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  It <i>is</i> bubblegum!

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Well, I guess you failed. Say goodbye to your dog.

[<i>She clutches her fist and starts pulling what's left of Jake into her bottom.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Aaaah!

<b>Finn</b>:  WAAIT!

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  What?

<b>Finn</b>:  If I learned <i>anything</i> today, it's that I'm <i>awesome</i> at talking to ladies! And, lady, you are crazy ugly!

<b>Tree Witch</b>: [<i>The Tree Witch does an almost silent gasp.</i>] Wha-a-a-t?

<b>Jake</b>:  Duuuude!

<b>Finn</b>:  Having beautiful hair isn't gonna get you anywhere, because you're ugly, inside <i>and</i> out, so ugly I want to <i>throw up</i>.

<b>Jake</b>:  Duuuude!

<b>Finn</b>:  No one will <i>ever</i> find you beautiful. <i>everrr!</i> And it's got nothing to do with the ol' chrome dome. It has to do with what's in here. [<i>Points to his heart.</i>] Can you get off my friend now?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Crying</i>] Du-hu-huuude...

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  He's right.

<b>Jake</b>:  Huh?

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Well, don't get me wrong. I know I'm ugly. And evil. [<i>She stands up, letting Jake free.</i>] But I thought if I had some beautiful hair, I could learn how to love myself.

[<i>Tree Witch starts to sob.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Gee... I feel kind of bad.

<b>Jake</b>:  I don't.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, witch! Does it have to be princess hair?

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  No. Just beautiful hair.

<b>Finn</b>:  Well then, check <i>this</i> out! [<i>Finn removes his hat, revealing an enormous amount of golden hair that seems to be flowing in the wind.</i>] HA HA-A-A-A-A-A!!!

[<i>Tree Witch and Jake both gasp in awe.</i>]

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  You'd really give me your hair?

<b>Finn</b>:  Sure!

[<i>A second passes on screen and Finn appears with no hair at all. The Tree Witch is now wearing his hair like a wig.</i>]

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  [<i>Excited</i>] So... how do I look?

<b>Finn</b>:  Totally beautiful. [<i>He puts his hat back on.</i>] inside <i>and</i> out!

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  Thank you, Finn. And now to use my hair for evil.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>terrified</i>] What?!

<b>Tree Witch</b>:  'Cause I'm evil!! [<i>Evilly laughs</i>] What did you want from me? [<i>She starts to run away but trips on her new hair. She moans in pain.</i>] Ohh -- Oh, no. I think I fractured a branch.

[<i>Finn and Jake both laugh at the Tree Witch until the episode ends.</i>]
