[<i><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a> are in the <a href="/wiki/Ice_Kingdom" title="Ice Kingdom">Ice Kingdom</a>, sneaking past a penguin guard</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Our secret mission to capture the <a href="/wiki/Ice_King" title="Ice King">Ice King</a> is underway. Though I probably shouldn’t say stuff like that out loud.

[<i>Ice King is in bed solving a puzzle and mumbling when his doorbell rings and goes to the front door</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Singing</i>] Who is it? [<i>Starts shooting ice lightning</i>] Zap zap zap zap zap zap zap! [<i>Sees a can on the ground</i>] Ooh, someone left me a gift. Peanut brittle? But I'm on a diet. [<i>Shakes can, snickers and opens the can; Jake pops out and takes his crown</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Should have stuck to your diet!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Throws can on the ground</i>] Oahh! Finn, you have destroyed my faith in canned peanut brittle! Zap! [<i>Nothing happens</i>] Oh, no, my crown has all my powers in it!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Tackles Ice King with a giant wrapper strip</i>] Wrap attack!

[Jake is holding Ice King, who is bound, gagged, and struggling]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>In baby talk</i>] How about I swaddle you up like a sweet baby.

[Jake wraps the Ice King up even more, who struggles all the more]

<b>Finn</b>:  We finally captured the Ice King!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>With Ice King tied to his back</i>] Why'd we do this again?

<b>Finn</b>:  <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess</a> explained it all when she sent us on the mission, remember?

[<i>Flashback to the <a href="/wiki/Tree_Fort" title="Tree Fort">Tree Fort</a> where Finn and Jake are talking to Princess Bubblegum via hologram</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Go capture the Ice King, and bring him to me.

[<i>Back in the present</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmm… That didn't really explain anything.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm sure she's got a good reason.

[<i>In a dark and gloomy <a href="/wiki/Candy_Kingdom" title="Candy Kingdom">Candy Kingdom</a></i>]

[<i>Finn and Jake with the Ice King walk into the gloomy, fog covered streets</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Where is everybody?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, this place is deserted, except for that guy.

[<i>Princess Bubblegum in a beak doctor mask comes walking towards them spraying fumigation gas</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Ich bin hier, Finn. ("I'm in here, Finn.")

[<i>Finn and Jake scream; Princess Bubblegum takes off her mask and reveals herself</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  It's me, the princess. Did you bring him?

<b>Finn</b>:  Sure did.

[<i>Jake shows Ice King, who mumbles, and Princess Bubblegum smiles</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  So, what did the Ice King do to—

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>cutting him off</i>] Ah-bababap! No time! Now quickly, with me!

[<i>They go to Princess Bubblegum's castle and walk up to a wall</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Ttubllaw!

[<i>Stone face appears on the wall</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Stonesy" title="Stonesy">Stonesy</a></b>:  What's the password?

[<i>Princess Bubblegum squeezes his cheeks</i>]

<b>Stonesy</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] Oh, you got me! [<i>Opens his mouth into a doorway</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  Secret door!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  This stairway leads to the dungeon where we'll toss that lousy Ice King!

<b>Finn</b>:  What awful thing did he do to get tossed in there?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Chhh, he didn't do anything. Not a thing.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wha?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  It's a long story, Finn. You see, the Ice King…

<b><a href="/wiki/Manfried" title="Manfried" class="mw-redirect">Manfried</a></b>:  [<i>Over an intercom</i>] Princess Bubblegum, you're needed at once in the Grand Hall.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  No! I need more time! [<i>Flips over a table</i>]

<b>Manfried</b>:  [<i>Hanging over on a tree with a bullhorn</i>] Gosh, I'm sorry.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Alright, alright, I have to go. You two just guard the Ice King until I return [<i>Creepily</i>] and be prepared to make him howl with pain.

<b>Finn</b>:  You got it, princess!

[<i>They go to the dungeon, an owl flies overhead as Finn, Jake, and Ice King stand around a table</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, this is a total rook!

<b>Jake</b>:  Settle down, prisoner! We gotta record your belongings. One magical crown, [<i>Whispers to Finn</i>] probably stolen.

<b>Ice King</b>: I didn't steal it! I made that item! …Made it with the magic that I stole! So hand it over, or I'll strike menacing poses at you! [<i>Starts striking poses and Finn sprays him with a hose</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Cool it, inmate! [<i>The water begins to whip Ice King</i>]

[<i>Ice King is in a jail cell with only two bars</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  These bars can't hold me forever! Hey there's only like two of 'em. You fools have no business guarding prisoners.

[<i>Finn and Jake are putting on helmets</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, yeah?! Well how 'bout these helmets we found? And we got the Oculus of Rehabilitation!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Hmm?

[<i>Ice King looks up and there is a giant eye looking at him</i>]

<b>Oculus</b>:  Be better!

<b>Finn</b>:  And the shelf of penitence!

[Ice King's crown is on a shelf sobbing with water coming from under it]

<b>Ice King's crown</b>:  [<i>Sobbing</i>] I'm sorry…I'm so sorry…

<b>Ice King</b>:  How about you just hand me my crown. I'll create some ice bars.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Running with the crown</i>] Okay!

<b>Finn</b>:  No, Jake! It's a trick.

<b>Ice King</b>:  I'm toying with you, ha ha, psychologically. [<i>laughs</i>]

[<i>Finn and Jake have built a full set of bars for the jail cell</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Finished!

<b>Ice King</b>:  So what am I being charged with?

<b>Finn</b>:  Umm…

<b>Jake</b>:  Five counts of jerkateering. Ha!

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, what does it matter?

<b>Ice King</b>:  Gah! Of course it matters! The way things work is first, I transgress your meaningless rules and then you maliciously persecute me!

<b>Finn</b>:  That makes sense. You do bad stuff, we punish you.

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Pokes Finn's face</i>] Fool! You have disrupted that order, for—are you ready for this?—I have committed no recent crime!

<b>Finn</b>:  Really? Umm…

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] I'm rockin' your worldview!

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, he is starting to convince me we're doing a bad thing.

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude, [<i>Licks him</i>] be calmed by my saliva and think of all the terrible things he's done.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah… yeah! You're still a jerk that deserves to be in jail.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, yeah? You know who really deserves to be in jail? I will show you the true jerks! [<i>Pulls out a mirrored covered with a blanket behind his jail cell bunk bed</i>] Behold! [<i>Lifts the blank off the mirror but in doing so extinguish the candle in the cell</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhh, it's too dark.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Behold! [<i>Brings the mirror into the light but it shatters at the bottom when he slams it on the floor</i>] Wha, Behold! [<i>Holds it in the air but it falls apart, Ice King groans and gasps and walks up to the cell bars with a mirror piece in his hand and puts it in Finn and Jake's faces</i>] Behold the true jerks!

<b>Finn</b>:  The jerks are us? Jake, am I going crazy? It seems like the Ice King is right about this. But if he's in the right, that means we're in…

<b>Jake</b>:  The Candy Kingdom!

<b>Finn</b>:  No, it means much, much worse.

[<i>Turns to the jail cell where Ice King is in bed and opens the door</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  On your feet.

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Gets out of bed</i>] Is it time for my hour in the yard, boss?

<b>Finn</b>:  No, we're letting you go. We decided that it's wrong to imprison you.

<b>Ice King</b>:  This is a trick, huh?

<b>Finn</b>:  Get out of here before I change my mind!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Walking out of the cell</i>] There must be someone waiting outside to beat me. Ooh, is that my crown over there? [<i>Goes offscreen</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Sighs</i>] I'm glad that's all taken care of.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, quite yet.

[<i>Finn goes into the cell and pull Jake inside with him and closes the door</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Awww…

<b>Finn</b>:  Sorry, but since we're the bad guys this time, we gotta go to jail.

<b>Jake</b>:  This sucks.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Hey!

[<i>Finn shrieks</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Get out of my room!

<b>Finn</b>:  You're still he— [<i>stutters</i>] …Just get out of here, man!

<b>Ice King</b>:  So, you're really breaking me out?

<b>Finn</b>:  Like I said, it's wrong to imprison you.

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Tearing up</i>] You mean, you believe me? Oh, can it be? Has all the hatred between us transmuted into something more? A friendship? A best friendship. [<i>Sticks out fist for a fist tap</i>] Knucks? [<i>Finn slaps his fist away</i>] Oh, ho ho, slaps in disgust, eh? Let's call them "Slappy D's"! Okay, see you later, my bosoms!

<b>Finn</b>:  I am no man's bosom.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Cast "Detect Secret Door"! [<i>He shoots a magic blast and a tunnel opens under the stairway</i>] Success! [<i>Runs away into the tunnel</i>] Wa ha ha ha!

[<i>Just after he leaves, Princess Bubblegum pops out of a tunnel on the floor</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Sorry for the delay.

<b>Jake</b>:  Man, there are a lot of secret door around here.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Puts on pink iron gloves</i>] And now, Ice King, prepare to howl with [<i>Sees he's gone</i>] pain?

<b>Finn</b>:  Wow, she's so proud we did the right thing, she almost looks enraged.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Takes off the gloves</i>] Where is the Ice King?

[<i>Outside Ice King is flying away</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Finally! Freedom and friends FOREVER!!!

[<i>Back in the dungeon</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  What have you done?! [<i>Flips over a table and snarls</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What have we done?

[<i>The cell door opens and Princess Bubblegum grab Finn and Jake</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  I'll show you. [<i>Carries them away</i>]

[<i>In the Grand Hall, Princess Bubblegum unveils a curtain</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  AHHH!!!

[<i>The room is full of <a href="/wiki/Candy_People" title="Candy People">Candy People</a>, covered in ice and lying on cots, sick and spreading ice to other Candy People</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Starchie" title="Starchie" class="mw-redirect">Starchie</a></b>:  Heah, even old Starchie's sick.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  A plague of <a href="/wiki/Freezer_Burn_Flu" title="Freezer Burn Flu">Freezer Burn Flu</a>.

<b>Finn</b>:  Ice King did this?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Well, yes and no.

[<i>Flashback</i>]

[<i>In the Candy Kingdom</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Narrating</i>] It happened 3 days ago.

[<i>Ice King flies overhead</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Hey, hey, Princess, check out my new trick! [<i>Starts rubbing flakes out of his beard</i>] It's snowing it's snowing for you!

[<i>Snow falls on the kingdom as the Candy People play in it</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [Narrating] We don't think he was trying to spread disease, but soon the entire kingdom was infect by his beard flakes.

[<i>Candy People turn blue and shiver, Princess Bubblegum is in her room reading</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Narrating</i>] Through my research, I quickly discovered that the only way to cure my people was to obtain the pained howls of the Ice King himself.

[<i>In the Ice Kingdom, Princess Bubblegum is riding <a href="/wiki/Lady_Rainicorn" title="Lady Rainicorn">Lady Rainicorn</a> with a sound device over a mountain Ice King is on top of</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Narrating</i>] But when I pleaded with him directly…

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Please, I beseech your aid. In the name of common decency!

<b>Ice King</b>:  So let me get this straight… You're hitting on me.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  No!

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>:  으으, 웃기시네! 너는 우리 공주님과 판결 상대도 안 될 그런 가치없는 놈이야! ("Are you joking? You are not even worth my Lady's disdain.")

<b>Ice King</b>:  I think I heard the word "Virile" in there. Oh, she is definitely hitting on me.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  No!

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>:  말도 안 돼! ("No!")

<b>Ice King</b>:  Be gone, you biddies!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Narrating</i>] He had his chance to help and he did nothing!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, my gosh, she came to me this time.

[<i>Flashback ends</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  I had no choice but to try and take his wails by force.

<b>Jake</b>:  By getting us to beat the tar out of him.

<b>Finn</b>:  I can't just beat up the Ice King for nothing. That's against my alignment.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  I know, I know. You're right. [<i>Starts to cry</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  But I'll get him to give up those howls. Voluntarily. I swear it.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Oh, thank you, Finn. I… [<i>Cries</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Places hand on her face</i>] Shhhh…

[<i>In the Ice Kingdom, Finn and Jake are running towards the Ice King's Castle</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude, how are we gonna get those howls?

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, I gotta plan to trick him, but you won't like it.

<b>Jake</b>:  That sounds ominous. I don't like it!

[<i>They enter the castle</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ice King, come forth!

<b>Ice King</b>:  I'm coming forth! Hee hee, is that the voice of friendship I hear? [<i>Walks in the room with a board game</i>] So, are you fellas ready for game night?

<b>Finn</b>:  Game night? Well, that's weird.

<b>Ice King</b>:  What? Why?

<b>Finn</b>:  You do know how friends act, right? You've had friends before.

<b>Ice King</b>:  I… yes?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, so you know how friends are always howling in pain for each other.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yeah… right! Everyone knows that! [<i>Laughs awkwardly</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Holds up the sound device</i>] Will you howl for me, pal?

<b>Ice King</b>:  Oooh, of course, friend. Awoo-hehehehe! Oh, I've got the sillies! I couldn't possibly without giggling uncontrollably. I'm just so giddy about you being here! [<i>Laughs, falls on his back and grabs the bottom of his cloak and rocks back and forth</i>] I'm a banana! [<i>Laughs</i>] Don't slip on me!

[<i>A shrunken Jake jumps on Finn's shoulder</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  We're out of options. Let's just beat it out of him.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, Jake! We…

<b>Ice King</b>:  [Gets up] Wait a sec, there's a bug on you, friend. Smack! [<i>Smacks Jake and in doing so hits Finn</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Grrr… Biscuits, now's my chance!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Shuffling through the board game, picks up a game piece</i>] You know, I carved these game pieces from my own teeth.

<b>Finn</b>:  Boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo…

<b>Ice King</b>:  Huh? Crying?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Boo hoo. You hit me, Ice King. I don't think I could live any more knowing my best bosom hit me.

<b>Ice King</b>:  I was only saving you from poo poo palms!

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm dying because I know you care not for me. [<i>Plays dead</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  No! No, my…my bosom! What hath I done?! My friend! [<i>Picks up Finn</i>] My only friend.

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey, what about me?

<b>Ice King</b>:  Why?! Why?! WHY?!!!

[<i>The scream is so loud it reaches the Candy Kingdom, where the ice falls off the sickened Candy People</i>]

<b>Starchie</b>:  Starchie's feeling healthy again! [<i>Grow muscles</i>] A bit too healthy if you ask me.

[<i>More Candy People are cured</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  They're all getting better! Finn and Jake did it! Ich bin so glücklich, ich könnte, ich könnte… ("I'm so happy, I could, I could…") [<i>Almost flips over a cot but faints on it</i>]

[<i>Back in the Ice Kingdom</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  WHY?!!!… Ah, well. <a href="/wiki/Gunter" title="Gunter">Gunter</a>! Dispose of Finn's carcass.

[<i>Finn pops up</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Sad</i>] Harumph.

<b>Jake</b>:  Good job! Those wails must have reached all the way to…

<b>Finn</b>:  Did you see how fast he dropped my lifeless body? That's just mean.

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn, if I came across your lifeless body, I'd clasp you dramatically for a kajillion years.

<b>Finn</b>:  Thanks, man.

<b>Jake</b>:  [Grows] Hey, why wait?! Play dead, Finn!

[Finn plays dead and jumps into Jake's arms and Jake hops away on the mountain tops toward the Candy Kingdom]

<b>Jake</b>:  Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?!

[<i>The episode ends with the Adventure Time logo</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  Adventure time!
