[<i>Jake is asleep on a seat; Finn crawls towards him</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Whispering</i>] Wizard Battle is starting soon!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Pushes Finn away, groans</i>] I know! We got here six hours early, you dork! Just wake me up when they start selling hot dogs. [<i>sees that he is laying on a hot dog</i>] Whoa! What do you know! [<i>Eee gasp</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  The wizards are arriving!

[<i>The crowd cheers as the wizard walk in and kneel</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoo-hoo! Yeah!!!

<b><a href="/wiki/Grand_Master_Wizard" title="Grand Master Wizard">Grand Master Wizard</a></b>:  [<i>Offscreen</i>] Ladies and gentlemen...

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gasps repeatedly</i>]

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>:  I am the Grand Master Wizard of Ceremonies. And now, the rules. Contestants will fight each other with spells from the eight schools of magic. [<i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Princess#Science_Whyzard" title="Doctor Princess">Science Whyzard</a> enters</i>] No science, Science Whyzard!

[<i>Weapon Head pouts and takes of his weapon head and throws it into a pile of prohibited wizard stuff and makes fire from his hands</i>] To enter Wizard Battle, you must be a wizard!

<b>Jake</b>:  Boo!

<b>Finn</b>:  You're a contestant?!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Mm-hmm. You guys come here to watch me win?

<b>Finn</b>:  Phshoo, you're gonna lose, man.

<b>Jake</b>:  You're a loser.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Ha! I'm not gonna lose! I've got a foolproof plan for winning. [<i>Whispers</i>] I'm gonna cheat. [<i>Laughs</i>]

[<i>The three are shadowed by a pink blimp</i>]

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>:  And now L's and G's, witness the unveiling of this tournaments grand prize, [<i>A curtain rises over the blimps cockpit revealing Princess Bubblegum</i>] A kiss from <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a>! [<i>Princess Bubblegum starts posing with her lips as the crowds cheer</i>] On the mouth!

[<i>A small group of three Lady Wizards look displeased</i>]

<b>Lady Wizard #1</b>:  Boooo. Boo.

<b><a href="/wiki/Brain_Wiz" title="Brain Wiz">Brain Wizard</a></b>:  Hmm. Is it an open mouth kiss?

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>:  No!

<b>Brain Wizard</b>:  Then I choose to exit the battle.

[<i>Brain Wizard begins to leave, the Lady Wizards go "Yeah"</i>]

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>:  No one is allowed to exit Wizard Battle! [<i>Turns the four wizards into cats; the door closes</i>] The doors are shut. [<i>A barrier covers the stadium. A bird flies by but gets hit by the barrier</i>] The sky barrier is in place. All of you will kiss the princess or die in battle.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Ooh, I just can't wait to taste that sweet Bubblegum. [<i>Flies off happy</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>blushing</i>] Jake, we gotta enter the contest and stop Ice King.

<b>Jake</b>:  But we're not wizards, man. What about the sanctity and honor of Wizard Battle?

<b>Finn</b>:  I'd rather sanctify PB's lips.

<b>Jake</b>:  Ooooh! You don't care about the Ice King. You just wanna kiss Princess Bubblegum.

<b>Finn</b>:  No! I wanna save the princess!

<b>Jake</b>:  Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do.

<b>Finn</b>:  I do!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, you do.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, shush! [<i>Carries Jake off</i>]

[<i>They hop into the pile of wizard stuff and come out in disguise, Jake is cover by a red cloak and has his paws out wear the arm and legs should be and Finn has his head poking out of the head hole with a green hood and a blue eye mask</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Now, where's the Ice King.

[<i>The wizards are warming up, Ice King is standing in a corner</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Over there!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Checking his breath</i>] Oh, yeah.

<b>Finn</b>:  We need a plan, man.

<b>Jake</b>:  Okay. When the wizards start to battle, let's go hide behind that rock.

[<i>It is sunset, Princess Bubblegum is still posing her lips</i>]

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>:  By the rays of the setting sun, the battle of wizards has begun!

[<i>Grand Master Wizard shoots a magic blast into the arena and the battle floor becomes covered in dust and magic spells, Finn and Jake dodge the spells and hide behind a rock, when the dust clears the wizards are gone as the light come on in the night</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Looks like everyone had the same plan.

[<i>The wizards are hiding behind various objects</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What are they waiting for?

<b><a href="/wiki/Abracadaniel" title="Abracadaniel">Abracadaniel</a></b>:  The opposites.

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh?

[<i>A small wizard crawls out from behind rock behind Finn</i>]

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  The wizards with opposite powers will take each other on first.

<b>Finn</b>:  And are you a wizard?

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  Yes. My name is Abracadaniel. [<i>Tries to make a rainbow appear but can only keep it up for a few seconds</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hi, Abracadaniel. My name is, uh, Magic... [<i>Jake forms his hand into a fist</i>] Fist.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Pops his head out of the head hole</i>] Whoa. This kid looks like a wimp.

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  Who's that?

<b>Finn</b>:  He's my, uh, magic second head.

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  Well, he's right. [<i>Sighs</i>] I only entered this contest 'cause I thought the prize would be money. But it's just a kiss!

<b>Finn</b>:  You mean, you don't care about kissing PB?

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  Blegh, no way. If I was the winner, I would turn my face so our lips [<i>gasps</i>] wouldn't touch and I would push Princess away. Turn and push, turn and push, turn and push...

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To Jake</i>]

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  ...turn and push, turn and push. Well, I'm going back to my cave to wait for someone to kill me. Goodbye.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait! Abracadanny, don't you worry about a thing. I'm gonna protect you.

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  You will?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, man. Also, I have an idea for how you can help me save PB's lips.

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  Oh, okay.

[<i>The sounds of a magic battle is heard, Ice King is fighting Flame Lord</i>] Oh look, opposites are going to battle.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yeaah!

[<i>In the battle Ice King brings out nunchucks and hits Flame Lord</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] Cheating!

[<i>Ice King hits Flame Lord unconscious</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  He's using a weapon!

<b>Jake</b>:  Why isn't the Grand Master Wizard seeing this?

[<i>The Grand Master Wizard is playing with cats</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Nun-chucks vanish! [<i>The nun-chucks retract into his sleeve</i>] Boo yah!

<b>Finn</b>:  Now's my chance to stop him.

[<i>The rock he is hiding behind opens its eyes and rises up</i>]

[<i>The sky opens up and meteors fall</i>]

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  Cantrip!

[<i>Abracadaniel shoots a rainbow over Rock Wizard</i>]

<b>Rock Wizard</b>:  Huh?

[<i>The rainbow disappears and the meteors fall; one lands on Abracadaniel</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gasp</i>] No! [<i>Finn dodges the meteors</i>] Jake, two o' clock!

[Jake's arm smashes an incoming meteor, Abracadaniel appears behind them]

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay, now to stop the [<i>Sees Abracadaniel</i>] Ice Kiiing...?

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  My body is squishy. That's how I survived.

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa! That's turbo amazing!

[<i>Ice King is screaming fighting sound, shooting magic and twirling his nun-chucks, Huntress Wizard jumps behind him, blast at him, misses and jumps away as Ice King swings his nun-chucks at her</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Stay close to me, Abracadaniel.

[<i>They run into the crowd of battling wizards and run into Cyclo. Abracadaniel shoots a rainbow at him and turns him pink</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Cyclo" title="Cyclo">Cyclo</a></b>:  What?! You turned me pink, bro!

[<i>Jake punches Cyclo and knocks him out and he lands on top of another knocked out wizard</i>]

[<i>Grand Master Wizard is playing with a cat and looks at the arena again</i>]

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>:  Three wizards remain. Time to get real. I wanna see some crazy wiz biz!

[<i>The crowd starts chanting "wiz biz!"</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Wiz biz! Wiz biz! Oh, I can almost taste those sweet lips. [<i>Makes a make-out face; Abracadaniel cringes</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Whispering</i>] Quick, listen! Now's the time for you to help me. [<i>Whispers in Abracadaniel's ear</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Hey, guys. Guys? What are you whispering? Come on! I gotta a surprise for yous fools.

[<i>They circle the Ice King</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yeah. That's right. Just a little closer. [<i>Reaches into his sleeve</i>] Ooh, what's in here? In my little sleevey hole? [<i>Pulls out his nun-chucks</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To Abracadaniel</i>] Watch out, man.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Whoo!

[<i>Ice King swings his nun-chucks at Abracadaniel but he dodges</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  You got this, Danny boy!

[<i>Abracadaniel shoots a rainbow at the nun-chucks and turns them into a butterfly</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  My nun-chucks! Nooo!!

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  Yes! [<i>Breathes hard</i>] I did it! I really did it. I'm a true wizard.

[<i>Jake gives him a thumbs up; the butterfly flies overhead</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  I have powers too, you butts! Yahh! Ice sword! [<i>Creates an ice sword</i>] Ice Shield! [<i>Creates an ice shield</i>]

[<i>Ice King heads towards them</i>]

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  Abracadaniel! [<i>Shoots another rainbow at the butterfly and it turns back into the nunchucks</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Wha? What you say? [<i>Nunchucks fall on his head</i>] B'oh! [<i>Falls unconcious</i>]

[<i>The crowd cheers</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Good job, Danny. You're not a wimp anymore. You should feel pretty good.

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  I do. I feel real good.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm gonna forfeit now. I only wanted to stop the Ice King.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Pops out of the shirt</i>] Uh-uh.

<b>Finn</b>:  I forfeit! I forfeit, everyone!

[<i>Grand Master Wizard turns him into a cat; the crowd cheers</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Meow.

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa.

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>:  Abracadaniel wins! You are the greatest wizard in Ooo!

<b>Abracadaniel</b>:  Oh, w-w-well thank you, Grand Master Wizard. I guess through this trial I have become a great wizard. I, I came here with no self-esteem and no chances, a will-o-wisp of a boy, but I walk out this arena a man. A confident man! Who deserves a kiss from a princess!

[<i>Finn gasps and his Finn arms bursts out of the cat's front paws and he tears his way out of the cat, and he grabs Abracadaniel</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

[<i>Finn covers his mouth; Abracadaniel gets knocked out by Finn's scream</i>]

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>:  It appears you have knocked out Abracadaniel using the most shameful of all magic, a power shriek. [<i>The crowd grumbles in discontent</i>] But since you are the last wizard, you are the winner of Wizard Battle. [<i>The crowd cheers</i>] Go get ready for your kiss, champ.

[<i>In the locker room, Finn looks depressed</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Sighs</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Comes out from under the cloak</i>] Wow, man.

<b>Finn</b>:  What?

<b>Jake</b>:  I've never heard you scream like that before. You were all like, "Nooo! No one kisses her but me!"

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, okay! I want to kiss her, alright? You got me! The big secret is out! Okay, Jake. I like Princess Bubblegum! ARE YOU HAPPY, JAKE?!

[<i>Jake has sad eyes as he lets out a tear</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa, Jake. Don't cry, man. I'm not really mad at you.

[<i>Jake looks happy as he sniffles a little</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm just sick of having to hide my feelings all the driz. It's exhausting.

<b>Jake</b>:  Then stop hiding you feelings, man! Go out there, and smooch it up!

<b>Finn</b>:  Heh heh. Yeah, alright, man.

[<i>Footsteps are heard, Finn jumps back on top of Jake, Grand Master Wizard opens the locker room door</i>]

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>:  You ready in there?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, I'm coming!

[<i>Finn walks back out into the stadium where some of the wizards are watching, Ice King is still unconscious, and Princess Bubblegum stands in front of her blimp with <a href="/wiki/Banana_Guard" title="Banana Guard" class="mw-redirect">Banana Guards</a> by her side; <a href="/wiki/Peppermint_Butler" title="Peppermint Butler">Peppermint Butler</a> is singing "<a href="/wiki/Ultimate_Prize_Song" title="Ultimate Prize Song">Ultimate Prize Song</a>" when Jake trips on Rock Wizard, who pops his head out of the ground</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ooh, whoa!

[<i>"Magic Fist" is revealed to everyone; everyone gasps and mumbles in surprise</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, dag.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  What's going on here?

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh, Ice King was cheating his way through Wizard Battle using nun-chucks, so Jake and I faked being wizards to save you from having to kiss him and we uh, [<i>Sighs</i>] I dishonored Wizard Battle.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Oh, Finn, ...you did all that for me? [<i>Kisses Finn</i>] That's for being sweet. [<i>Slaps him</i>] And that's for cheating. Finn, you know better than to ruin the sanctity of Wizard Battle. Wizards only, silly. Okay, everyone! Go home! Start getting ready for next year!

[<i>The wizards grumbling, leave along with Princess Bubblegum</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Heh heh, oh, well.

<b>Jake</b>:  Good job. You got the kiss, man.

<b>Finn</b>:  Thanks, man. My face hurts a little.

[<i>Jake puts his Finn's eye mask back on Finn's face</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Don't worry about that, 'cause you look totally cool right now.

<b>Finn</b>:  Thanks, dude. [<i>Puts the mask on Jake</i>] Here, you try 'em.

<b>Jake</b>:  Okay, am I cool now?

<b>Finn</b>:  So fly.

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Out of nowhere, wearing purple sunglasses</i>] How 'bout me? Put me on the grid, scale of one to ten. One is "totally gross," ten is like, "Dang, Ice King. You look crazy sick."

[<i>Finn and Jake are only staring at Ice King....</i>]
