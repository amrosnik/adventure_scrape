[<i>The episode begins showing a <a href="/wiki/Tree_of_Blight" title="Tree of Blight">black tree</a>. It turns to show its face.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>:  The Tree of Blight.

[<i>The tree roars in the center of a dark forest; the camera pans out to show Finn and <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a>.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land.

<b>Jake</b>:  Then let's burn its butt down to the root rubbin's. [<i>The duo walks forward.</i>] Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin' us from the woods.

[<i>The <a href="/wiki/Beautiful_Lady" title="Beautiful Lady">Alpha Hug Wolf</a> suddenly lunges out and Finn and Jake gasp. She lands next to the duo and punches Finn rather softly.</i>]

<b>Alpha Hug Wolf</b>:  Huuugs!

<b>Finn</b>:  What the—?! Is this an extra butt?! [<i>Pushes her away.</i>] Quick, Jake! Burn the tree!

[<i>Jake runs off.</i>]

<b>Alpha Hug Wolf</b>: Huuuugs! [<i>Finn grunts and they begin circling each other</i>] Gonna hug you up, boy! I'm gonna snuggle you to pieces!

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over!

<b>Finn</b>:  No! [<i>Gasps as the ‎Alpha Hug Wolf makes a roaring charge at him. The ‎Alpha Hug Wolf embraces Finn and howls.</i>] Jake, hurry!

<b>Jake</b>:  Is he crushin' you, man?!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Lowering his voice slightly</i>] No, he's just... hugging me gently!

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh...! [<i>Turns and talks to tree</i>] When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell 'im Jake says, "Hello."

[<i>Jake sets the tree on fire which makes it explode; a piece of the tree lands on the ‎Alpha Hug Wolf and she runs off screaming. Finn is violently coughing.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey, buddy, you okay?

<b>Finn</b>:  Didn't even tell me its name...

<b>Jake</b>:  Wha..,?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Noticing the tree is burned down</i>] Oh, sweet! Ha-ha-ha!

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  [<i>In unison</i>] Hot to the touch!

[<i>Scene cuts to Finn and Jake's Tree Fort. Jake is whistling and playing <a href="/wiki/Portender_Defender" title="Portender Defender">Portender Defender</a> on <a href="/wiki/BMO" title="BMO">BMO</a>. He notices Finn is hugging BMO and stops playing.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmmmm... Dude, why're you so huggy?

<b>Finn</b>:  I just feel affectionate, I guess. Hugging helps.

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmm... [<i>Feels Finn's forehead</i>] You've got a fever, man.

<b>Finn</b>:  I feel hot. [<i>Holds BMO tighter</i>]

<b>BMO</b>:  Finn, you're hurting me.

<b>Jake</b>:  I think you need a good night's sleep.

[<i>Scene transition to Finn and Jake's bedroom. Finn is seen hugging a pillow and Jake blows out a candle. Finn whines like a dog in his sleep. Cut to the next day; Finn and Jake are picking up litter in the <a href="/wiki/Candy_Kingdom" title="Candy Kingdom">Candy Kingdom</a>.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  You feelin' better today?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah. I feel like a million clams.

<b>Jake</b>:  Good. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter? [<i>Eats some of it</i>] Litter for lunch! Mmm!

[<i>Finn continues picking it up and <a href="/wiki/Cinnamon_Bun" title="Cinnamon Bun">Cinnamon Bun</a> enters and runs into Finn.</i>]

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>:  Huh? Not again!

<b>Finn</b>:  What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun?

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>:  Please, Finn. If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night.

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh... I didn't hug you last night.

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>:  Yes, you did! My love handles still hurt! You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze—a really strong one! [<i>Groans in pain</i>]

[<i>Jake joins in.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  CB says I hugged 'im. Haha. Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions. I tell ya. [<i>Laughs; Cinnamon Bun also starts to laugh. Jake just makes a worried face. Cinnamon Bun exits as his laugh fades. Finn and Jake sit down.</i>] Oh, Cinnamon Bun. [<i>Eats some candy litter</i>] [<i>Muffled</i>] What a crazy story, buddy.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you?

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm just sayin' you were really clingy.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Eats more litter</i>] [<i>Muffled</i>] But no. Why would I? And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun.

<b>Jake</b>:  No. I have a theory, ...but I don't like it.

[<i>Scene cuts to a library.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right?

<b>Finn</b>:  ...So...?

[<i>Jake pulls out a <a href="/wiki/Bestiarium_Vocabulum" title="Bestiarium Vocabulum">book</a> and drops it on the ground. Jake opens it.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf. Yeah, here it is. [<i>Reading book</i>] "<a href="/wiki/Hug_Wolves" title="Hug Wolves">Hug wolves</a>—a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust. Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon."!

<b>Finn</b>:  Like last night!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf. A lower-level creature.

<b>Finn</b>:  Well, how can I get uncursed?

<b>Jake</b>:  Lemme, um... read the book a little more. Says there's no known cure.

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh... I'm scared, Jake... [<i>Attempts to hug Jake but he slaps him away</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  No hugs!!

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm sorry! [<i>Grunts</i>] I feel hot! Rrrrr!!

[<i>Jake looks worried. Cut back to the <a href="/wiki/Tree_Fort" title="Tree Fort">Tree Fort</a> where Jake is covering Finn with bags of frozen peas. BMO is whimpering.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  What's wrong, BMO?

<b>BMO</b>:  I am terrified of Finn.

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you. [<i>BMO stops shielding himself in disbelief</i>] You can get this under control, buddy. ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??

<b>Finn</b>:  I think so.

<b>Jake</b>:  I said... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah. I heard you. I said I think so.

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh. Okay. IS THIS GOOD?!?

<b>Jake</b>:  Never mind. Now. I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel?

<b>Finn</b>:  Prickly and painful.

<b>Jake</b>:  Good, good, you're doin' great!

<b>Finn</b>:  Cool. So, can I hug the cactus now?

<b>Jake</b>:  No, you can't hug anything.

<b>Finn</b>:  But that poor cactus! It... it... NEEDS ME! [<i>Stands up and knocks bags of peas off body, knocking Jake down. He pants heavily then growls.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Growling fiercely</i>] I want to hug you, Jake! Close!

[<i>Jake ties Finn up with rope then chains him down.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn... say something to reassure me.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'LL HUG YOUR <a href="/wiki/Margaret" title="Margaret">MOM</a>!

[<i>Jake makes a frightened noise and backs away quickly.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>:  Jake! We need the silver baseball!

[<i>The full moon outside is shown and shines from behind the clouds. Finn completes his transformation.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hrrugs!! HUGS FOR BUDDIES! [Howls]

<b>Finn</b>:  Bring it in, guys!

<b>BMO</b>:  Screamoooo!

<b>Jake</b>:  BMO! Strobe light mode! [<i>BMO activates his strobe lights.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Not cool!

<b>Jake</b>:  Back, beast!

<b>Finn</b>:  Hug wolf, away!

[<i>Finn busts out of a window howling and runs to the Candy Kingdom. The scene cuts there.</i>]

[<i>Finn jumps to the <a href="/wiki/Gumdrop_teenager" title="Gumdrop teenager">Gumdrop teenager</a>'s balcony and enters her room and creeps towards her in bed</i>]

<b>Gumdrop dad</b>:  Ch-ch. [<i>Fake gunshot noise; repeats a couple of times as Finn runs away</i>] Ch-ch. [<i>Goes towards window</i>] Eh... eh... SHE'LL NEVER MARRY! [<i>Chases Finn away with more gunfire</i>]

[<i>Transition to the next day; Jake is walking with BMO in the Candy Kingdom.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn? Finn?

<b>BMO</b>:  There he is!

[Finn is in a river. Jake shakes him awake.]

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh? Huh? [<i><a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a> chases a cat in the background</i>] What... What happened? Jake... what happened to me last night?

<b>Jake</b>:  You hugged... everyone.

<b>Finn</b>:  NO!

<b>Finn [<i>Fully transformed</i>]</b>:  Cinnamon Bun... let me out...

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>:  I-I-I-I'm not supposed to.

<b>Finn</b>:  Don't you want a hug?

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>:  I can't, man!

<b>Alpha Hug Wolf</b>:  I'm gonna hug you up.

<b>Finn</b>:  You call that a hug?

[<i>They continue their battle.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  This is the biggest hug that's ever existed!

[<i>Finn and the wolf begin sparking as they battle. The ‎Alpha Hug Wolf forces Finn near a cliff, but Finn gets a hold of her before she can push him off. They both start glowing; they howl as soon an explosion occurs and forms a heart-shaped cloud that blows several <a href="/wiki/Mountain_goat" title="Mountain goat">mountain goats</a> away. The smoke clears.</i>]

<b>Finn [<i>Back to normal</i>]</b>:  Uuuugghhh... Huh? [<i>Finn notices that the ‎Beautiful Lady is also back to normal; she lets out tired groans</i>] You... You stopped hugging me.
