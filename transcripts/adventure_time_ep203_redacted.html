<b>BMO</b>: Football, you don't mean that.

<b>Football</b>: I do, BMO. I don't say things I don't mean. You look very smart and very handsome today.

<b>Football</b>: I love you, BMO.

<b>BMO</b>: Can I tell you a secret?

<b>Football</b>: Of course, BMO. You can tell me anything.

<b>BMO</b>: I love you.

<b>Football</b>: Oh. [<i>giggles</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: Now you tell me a secret, Football.

<b>Football</b>: I wish I could spend just one day on the other side of the mirror.

<b>BMO</b>: Well, let's switch places for the day.

<b>Football</b>: Oh, BMO, you'd do that for me?

<b>BMO</b>: Yes, Football. Because I love you.

<b>Football</b>: Oh, BMO.

[<i>BMO pushes against the mirror.</i>]

[<i>The stool starts rocking, then stops. BMO and Football stop pushing.</i>]

<b>Football</b>: Oh! [<i>panting</i>] Oh! [<i>laughs</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: [<i>in mirror</i>] See you back here tomorrow, Football. [<i>waves</i>]
