<b>BMO</b>:  [<i>Continues dancing</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey, dude, can I borrow that paper?

<b>Finn</b>:  Mm-hmm.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Whistles; rolls up paper; hits BMO with it</i>] Bad computer! No! No! [<i>Music stops.</i>] Now go sit in the corner and think about your life.

<b>Snorlock</b>:  Salt?! But I heard you guys were heroes.

<b>Finn</b>:  We <i>are</i> heroes. We thought you were trying to attack us. Why'd you break in here all mad, squirting that juice all over us?

<b>Snorlock</b>:  It's not <i>mad</i> juice. It's <i>sad</i> juice. My name's Snorlock, and I'm sa-a-a-a-d! [<i>Sobbing</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Stop squirting slime! Just tell us what's wrong!

<b>Snorlock</b>:  I need a girlfriend. I have no one to love.

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, hero huddle. [<i>They huddle</i>] What do you think?

<b>Jake</b>:  I think our house is all jacked up.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, but he's just an innocent goober looking for love.

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, what time is it?!

<b>Jake</b>:  I don't know, but you're probably going to say...

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  Lady time! [<i>LADY TIME screen card; Wolf whistle</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay, Snorlock, if you want a lady, you have to be yourself.

<b>Snorlock</b>:  How do I be myself?

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh, how does he be himself, Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  Just do whatever you want, man, as long as it comes from the inside.

<b>Snorlock</b>:  Like sad juice?

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  No!

<b>Jake</b>:  You keep that stuff inside you, brother. You just got to talk to 'em.

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh... WHA!

<b>Jake</b>:  Mm-mmm! [<i>Sniffs Finn's hand</i>] mm-mmm! [<i>Deep voice</i>] Girl, you smell good. Did you take a bath in rainbows and cupcakes?

<b>Jake</b>:  Aw, it's okay, buddy. Come here and give us a hug.

<b>Snorlock</b>:  Man, I wish you guys were ladies.

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhh.

<b>Jake</b>:  Stay focused, Snorlock. You have any cool talents that ladies might like?

<b>Snorlock</b>:  No.

<b>Jake</b>:  Umm, hey, Finn, teach him how to use swords. The princesses <i>always</i> love this one.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Preforms stabbing motions and flips</i>] Yah! yah! yah! yah! Yaaaah! hyah!

<b>Jake</b>:  Do you think you can do that, Snorlock?

<b>Snorlock</b>:  I don't know.

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmm. Maybe you're musical. Can you do this? [<i>Inhales deeply, begins beatboxing</i>] Try doin' all that.

<b>Snorlock</b>:  Hmm. [<i>Grunts, grows arms, grabs the swords then begins beatboxing and twirling swords</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake </b>:  Whoo-hoo! yeah!

<b>Snail Lady #3</b>:  My word, Eleanor! What is that alluring sound?

<b>Eleanor</b>:  I have no idea.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, Snorlock! Show us that talent!

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoo-hoo!

[<i>A herd rushes over in the trio's direction.</i>]

<b>Snail Ladies</b>:  Oh, my! What is that? What is that wonderful sound? Do I see swords?

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, these chicks look pretty serious.

<b>Jake</b>:  Let's just let Snorlock do his thing. Go to it, buddy! [<i>Grabs Finn and sits on top of observatory boat</i>]

<b>Snail Ladies</b>:  [<i>Snorlock beatboxing continues</i>] Ahh! Ooh! Ahh.

<b>Jake</b>:  Look at him go! Bringing in the ladies.

<b>Snail Ladies</b>:  [<i>Crowding around Snorlock and begin grinding on him</i>] Mm!

[<i>Scene: inside of shaking house, objects are falling and breaking, BMO is sliding around.</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Both screaming</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Snorlock! These ladies are ruining our tree house! Stop!

[<i>Snorlock continues beatboxing as the Snail Ladies kiss him.</i>]

[<i>The continuous grinding wrecks the house even more.</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  Whoa!

<b>Jake</b>:  Wedge, dude!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Grunting</i>] [<i>Sticks sword into house's top to pull it off Snorlock</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Grunting</i>] It's no use, man. It's stuck with snail slime.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gets shoved back and forth between the Snail Ladies</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn! Aah! [<i>Also gets shoved back and forth between the Snail Ladies</i>]

[<i>Finn &amp; Jake land hard on the ground and then stand up.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  How are we gonna get our house back?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake flashes back to the salt shaker, cue Snorlock yelling "Salt!"</i>] Dude, I'm going in.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wha? Jake! No! You'll get slimed or grinded on!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Runs and then jumps into the house window</i>] Hmph!

[<i>He grabs the salt shaker and dives back outside to a waiting Finn.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gasps as he sees what Jake has</i>] [<i>Nods</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Snorlock, I'm gonna give you till the count of three, mister!

[<i>Snorlock continues.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  One, two, three!

[<i>Snorlock continues.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Fine. I didn't want to have to do this. [<i>Taps out a single grain of salt onto his palm</i>] [<i>Inhales deeply and then blows it in Snorlock's direction</i>]

[<i>The beatboxing slows as the salt approaches. Snorlock spots it and the beatboxing stops. The grain lands and leaves a huge burn mark.</i>]

<b>Snorlock</b>:  Aaaaaah! [<i>Bucks the house off his back</i>] Ow! ow! Owwwwwww!

<b>Snail Lady #4</b>:  Oh, my gosh! He's naked!

<b>Snail Ladies</b>:  [<i>Laughter</i>]

<b>Snorlock</b>:  What? I'm naked? But I've never had a shell.

<b>Jake</b>:  Snorlock, you never a shell? That means you're not naked. You're a slug!

<b>Snorlock</b>:  Me, a slug?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, man. That's why you have trouble with snail chicks. You need slug chicks.

<b>Snorlock</b>:  [<i>Pouting</i>] I don't known any slug chicks.

<b>Slug Lady</b>:  Actually, I-I'm not really a snail. I'm a slug. My shell's made of peppermint.

<b>Snorlock</b>:  [<i>Laughs happily</i>]

[<i>Scene: Snorlock and Slug Lady smooching</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  That's gross!

<b>Jake</b>:  I don't know why they have to make out so close to our house.

<b>Finn</b>:  I don't know. Come on, let's finish rebuilding it. I got some ear plugs you can borrow.

[<i>Up-tempo electronic music plays</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Where's that music coming from?

<b>BMO</b>:  [<i>Watching the two slugs</i>] Go! go! go! go!

<b>Finn</b>:  BMO! Get over here and help us rebuild the tree house.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah. You live here, too!

<b>BMO</b>:  [<i>Increases volume</i>]
