[<i>She adds the explosive diarrhea and a giant cloud shaped like a skull puffs out. <u>Not</u> a good omen.</i>]

<b>Finn and Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oooo...

<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>: Hey Princess Bubblegum, when we bring the dead back to life, will it be filled with <i>worms</i>?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No. If my <a href="/wiki/Decorpsinator_serum" title="Decorpsinator serum">decorpsinator serum</a> works, all the dead <a href="/wiki/Candy_People" title="Candy People">Candy People</a> will look as young and healthy as you do.

[<i>Finn does a "Tarzan-yell" while hitting his hands against his chest.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Pick up that platter, tough guy.

[<i>Finn picks up a serving platter and open the lid, revealing a Candy Person corpse.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Old <a href="/wiki/Candy_Person_107" title="Candy Person 107">Mr. Cream Puff</a>?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>Giggles</i>] We used to date. [<i>Applies the serum.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Something's happening! Come on, come on...

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Work.

[<i>A zombie Mr. Cream Puff arises and moans.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Algebraic!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Wait, something's wrong.

<b>Zombie Mr. Cream Puff</b>: Sugar! [<i>Squirts serum out of his eyes and mouth</i>]

<b>Finn and Princess Bubblegum</b>: Ew!

[<i>Zombie Mr. Cream Puff leaps into a giant test tube. The test tube falls and infects the whole cemetery. Zombie Candy People begin to arise from their graves.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, look, the decorpsinator serum is working!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No, this is wrong. They're not coming back to life--they're still dead! The decorpsinator serum--<i>it's incomplete!</i> [<i>she rubs the head of a candy person that looks like a love heart.</i>]

<b>Zombie Love Heart</b>: [<i>lashing out at Princess Bubblegum</i>] Rah. Must eat sugar!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Pushes him back down</i>] You're grounded, Mister.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh, this is really bad. They're going to be attracted to the Candy Kingdom!

<b>Finn</b>: Why?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Because the Candy People are made of <i>sugar</i>, ya ding dong!

<b>Zombie Mr. Cream Puff</b>: [<i>On Princess Bubblegum</i>] Gimme some sugar, baby.

<b>Finn</b>: Chew on this! [<i>Kicks him</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>Giggles</i>] Good one, Finn. Quickly, to the kingdom!

[<i>They run out of the cemetery</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Kicks another zombie</i>] Get a life!

[<i>Princess Bubblegum is at the top of her castle, ringing a large bell</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: All citizens of the Candy Kingdom! Report to the palace, immediately!

[<i>Candy People mumble in confusion and walk to the palace</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Whoa!

[<i>Jake and Lady go off to the palace. Princess Bubblegum notices the zombies slowly leaving the cemetery.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>worried</i>] Hurry, sweet citizens.

<b>Finn</b>: Alright, you heard the princess, everyone in! Alright, no pushing, come on!

<b>Jake</b>: Dude, what's up?

<b>Finn</b>: The princess will explain everything. Tree Trunks, get those <i>hot</i> buns in here, girl.

<b>Finn</b>: Thanks, Manfried.

<b>Manfried</b>: You're welcome.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Citizens, we are assembled here in the candy foyer for a momentous announcement. Tonight we are all going to have... a slumber party!

<b>Finn</b>: <i>What?!</i>

[<i>Crowd cheers</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Wait! What about the zom--?! [<i>Princess Bubblegum covers his mouth</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Go ahead and start partying.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Voice muffled</i>] But, Princess, the Undead--

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>Carries Finn to the lab</i>] We'll be right back, everyone.

<b>Jake</b>: Whooo!

[<i>In the lab</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Finn, the Candy People can't know about the zombies.

<b>Finn</b>: Wha?!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: If they knew, they would flip out.

<b>Finn</b>: What do you mean "flip out"?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I mean they would <i>flip out</i>.

[<i>Scene changes to the cemetery; Starchie arrives with a shovel.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Starchie" title="Starchie" class="mw-redirect">Starchie</a></b>: Princess? It's me, Starchie the gravedigger. I brought you a larger corpse shovel. Oh, Princess? Well, I'll just wait for you here, then. By the mausoleum. With my back turned. And my defenses lowered.

[<i>As Starchie does so, Candy Zombie comes out of the mausoleum and goes up to Starchie, Starchie starts to scream and gasp and then... <b>KABOOM!!!</b> He explodes in a flash of light. Back at the castle.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Candy People explode when they get scared?!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Not telling the Candy People about the zombies is so important that you need to promise, <i>Royal Promise</i>, not to let anyone find out about the zombies, ever.

<b>Finn</b>: Okay, sure.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No, Finn. You have to <i>Royal Promise.</i>

<b>Finn</b>: Yes, [<i>kneels</i>] I Royal Promise.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Now I must cloister myself in the lab and finish the equation to my decorpsinator serum. You keep the candy folk distracted and ignorant. Can you do that?

<b>Finn</b>: Yes, your highness.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Good. Don't tell anyone about the zombies. Never ever. [<i>She leaves</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: No, wait. Can I at least tell [<i>Jake enters</i>] Jake?

<b>Jake</b>: Tell me about what, dude?

<b>Finn</b>: You know, about the outbreak of zom-- [<i>Covers his mouth</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Chuckles</i>] Alright, what's going on?

<b>Finn</b>: Uhh, nothing at all, buddy! [<i>Laughs awkwardly and skips into the foyer</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, dude. I think you and Bubblegum are up to something.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>nervously</i>] Ahha ah, what? No, no way.

<b>Jake</b>: Whoa, you guys <i>are</i> up to something. Is it some sort of prank? Can I get in on it?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>To party-goers</i>] Who wants to play "Truth or Dare"?

<b>Jake</b>: Hmm...

<b>Finn</b>: Ok, Chocoberry, you may ask someone to tell a deep truth or a saucy dare.

<b><a href="/wiki/Candy_Person_2" title="Candy Person 2">Chocoberry</a></b>: Mr. Cupcake, truth or dare?

<b><a href="/wiki/Candy_Person_3" title="Candy Person 3">Mr. Cupcake</a></b>: Dare.

<b>Chocoberry</b>: I dare you to take off your wrapper.

[<i>Everyone goes "Oooh"</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Shoulders Finn</i>] Hey seriously, man. I'm your bro. Bros are supposed to tell bros everything all the time. What are you and Bubblegum up to? Is everything alright?

<b>Finn</b>: Yep! Fine! Everything is great! Heh, heh. [<i>Crinkling sound</i>] Except for that. Whoa.

[<i>Mr. Cupcake has shed his wrapper</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Peppermint_Butler" title="Peppermint Butler">Peppermint Butler</a></b>: I didn't know he was chocolate.

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>: Jake, truth or dare?

<b>Jake</b>: Truth.

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>: Do you prefer chocolate or fudge?

<b>Jake</b>: I can't eat chocolate or fudge 'cause I'm a dog and they'd probably kill me, but hmmmmm probably... neither. Finn! Truth or dare?

<b>Finn</b>: Dare! Haha!

<b>Jake</b>: I dare you... to tell me the truth about what's going on in your mind. What were you and Bubblegum talking about when you were alone together?

[<i>Everybody goes "Oooh"</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Nervously</i>] Umm, ahh, the truth is, ahhh...

[<i>Finn visualizes Princess Bubblegum's face on Jake</i>]

<b>Hallucination of Princess Bubblegum</b>: You promised you wouldn't freakin' tell anyone! Oh, you're so cute, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>: Ahhh... the truth is... that I'd rather play Dodge Socks!

[<i>Finn throws a sock at Jake, Princess Bubblegum's face goes away</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: I'm not playing dodge socks 'til you stop dodging my questions. Hey... [<i>Sniffs socks</i>] Old Mr. Cream Puff? Isn't he dead?

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, give me my sock back! Dodge Socks was a bad idea!

<b>Jake</b>: Whoa. [<i>angrily</i>] Look dude, just tell me what's up, 'cause you are crazier than a cannonball tonight.

[<i>Finn looks out a window behind Jake and sees the zombies coming</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Thinking</i>] Oh, my goodness! Princess hasn't finished the equation and the zombies are here!

<b>Finn</b>: I, uh, she just want this slumber party to be super fun, and if I did have something to tell you, then I would in a second, and it would make my life easier, unless there was something stopping me, like a promise, but there isn't, so I won't, so it's cool.

[<i>Zombie arises by the window behind Jake</i>]

<b>Zombie</b>: Sugar!

[<i>Finn shuts the shutters</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: What? You lost me.

<b>Finn</b>: Umm... Hey, you know what time it is?

<b>Jake</b>: Adventure time?

<b>Finn</b>: No, time for Seven Minutes in Heaven! You're first.

<b>Jake</b>: Really?

<b>Finn</b>: Lady Rainicorn! In the closet with Jake!

<b>Lady</b>: 뭐? 나? 웃겨 정말. 그래, 좋아. 하자. ("What? Me? You gotta be kidding me. Okay, then. I'll play.")

<b>Jake</b>: Okay, okay, alright. [<i>Closet door closes on Jake and Lady</i>] But in seven minutes, I'm gonna come out and make you spill your beans, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>: I can't hear you all the way in heaven!

[<i>Finn looks out a window, a horde of zombies shouting "Sugar" comes and begins banging on door</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Chet" title="Chet">Chet</a></b>: Umm, does anyone else hear that?

<b>Finn</b>: What? Hear what? I, I don't hear anything.

[<i>Candy People begin to murmur as they too hear the banging.</i>]

<b>Chet</b>: I hear something I don't understand... and it makes me scared! [<i>Begins to shake.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What? No, Chet. Everybody, wait. What noise? You mean <i>this</i> noise? [<i>Turns on a radio and party lights comes on.</i>]

<b>Chet</b>: Oh. [<i>Laughs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah! Dance it! Bust it up! Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh!

[<i>A zombie comes out of the main door, Finn rushes to the door, grabbing a table</i>]

<b>Chocoberry</b>: What is this game you are playing at now, Finn?

[<i>Finn barricades the door with the table</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Uhh, it's... <a href="/wiki/Blockado" title="Blockado">Blockado</a>. Haha, the game of barricades. Come on, let's block all the entrances and windows!

[<i>Candy People cheer and begin blockading the doors and windows before the zombies can come in</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Alright, this is not a permanent solution. Think Finn, how can you keep everyone from finding out?

<b>Manfried</b>: Find out about what, Finn?

<b>Finn</b>: Manfried, the talking piñata! Your convenient appearance gives me a great idea. Everyone, grab a stick! New game! We're gonna smash some piñatas!

<b>Manfried</b>: What?

<b>Finn</b>: Except for you, Manfried.

<b>Manfried</b>: Oh, thank goodness.

[<i>Finn takes some strips off of <a href="/wiki/Taffy_Girl" title="Taffy Girl">Taffy Girl</a></i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Now everybody don these blindfolds. [<i>Whispering</i>] Thanks, Taffy Girl.

[<i>Finn runs into the middle of the blindfolded Candy People swinging sticks</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Alright, everybody, get together. I'm hanging the piñatas... [<i>The zombies burst through the barricades</i>] They're all around you. Smash the piñatas!

[<i>Finn and the Candy People smash all the zombies</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah! You guys are on fire!

[<i>Chocoberry smashes a zombie, causing candy to fall out. She kneels down and licks the candy.</i>]

<b>Chocoberry</b>: Oh, it is so tasty.

[<i>All the Candy Zombies are smashed and the Candy People are eating their candy</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Yes! We did <i>it</i>! My improbable plan worked!

[<i>Jake and Lady come out of the closet</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Whew!

<b>Lady</b>: 안녕! ("Hello!")

<b>Jake</b>: Seven minutes up yet? [<i>Grabs a jelly filled doughnut and eats it, noticing the zombie corpses.</i>] Whoa! [<i>Runs to Finn</i>] What the nuts happened here?!

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, we killed all the zombies that Princess Bubblegum and I raised from the dead.

<b>Jake</b>: Really!?

[<i>Time freezes, leaving only Finn moving in the room.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Jake? What's going on?

[<i>Princess Bubblegum enters, unaffected by the freezing.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: What? Huh? Oh, <i>Finn!</i> Did you break your Royal Promise?

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, but, I mean, all the zombies are dead. The Candy People won't freak out. What's the big deal?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: This is really, really bad, Finn. You can't break Royal Promises. Never, ever, never. No matter what, forever.

[<i>The room starts shaking</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: The Guardians of the Royal Promise are coming for us.

[<i>A hand bursts through the ceiling and grabs Finn and Princess Bubblegum and pulls them outside</i>]

<b>Finn and Princess Bubblegum</b>: Whoa!

<b><a href="/wiki/Gumball_Guardian" title="Gumball Guardian">Guardian 1</a></b>: Finn the Human. You have broken a Royal Promise for which the penalty is trial by fire.

[<i>Guardian 2 breathes fire</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: That's stupid.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Wait! He's my friend! Isn't there another option?!

<b>Guardian 1</b>: Yes. Because you care for the promise-breaker, we will give him a less hot trial. You must now answer...

<b>Guardian 2</b>: ...Math questions!

<b>Finn</b>: Mathematical!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Finn, you're terrible at math.

<b>Finn</b>: Awww.

<b>Guardian 1</b>: Now, solve this! [<i>Puts Finn in front of Guardian 2, who puts up a hologram of an overly complicated math equation</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Uhh....

<b>Guardian 2</b>: Oh, wait, wait, I thought of a better one. [<i>Replaces the equation with one that says "2+2"</i>]

<b>Guardian 1</b>: Yes! Two plus two. Solve it or die.

<b>Finn</b>: Uhh. Four, right?

[<i>Guardians laugh</i>]

<b>Guardian 1</b>: Oh, correct.

[<i>Guardians heads explode and time rewinds, night becomes day, Guardian 2's head comes back and he talks backwards and goes back to sitting and blowing bubbles around the Candy Kingdom.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What's happening, Princess?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: You've defeated the broken royal promise! The Gumball Guardians are resetting!

[<i>Guardian 1 drops Finn and Princess Bubblegum, who teleport back to Princess Bubblegum's lab</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Slamacow! That was tops! Who's not good at math? I was all "Four!"

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Four, four... Four, four, four... That's it! The answer was so simple, I was too smart to see it!

<b>Finn</b>: You're welcome!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: '4' is the last figure I need to perfect my decorpsinator serum.

[<i>In the foyer, Princess Bubblegum pours the serum on a zombie</i>]

<b>Revived Zombie</b>: Golly!

[<i>Finn and Princess Bubblegum pour the serum on all the zombies</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Woohoo! Yeah!

<b>Jake</b>: This is messed up, but sweet.

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>: 진짜로. ("Truly it is.")

[<i>Finn and Princess Bubblegum revive more Candy Zombies</i>]

<b>Candy Person 1</b>: <a href="/wiki/Candy_Person_102" title="Candy Person 102">Uncle Chewy</a>!

<b><a href="/wiki/Candy_Person_108" title="Candy Person 108">Ice Cream Lady</a></b>: Former dead relative!

<b>Jake</b>: Starchie!

<b>Starchie</b>: Mornin'.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Walks over to Finn</i>] Man, you broke a Royal Promise? You're nuts. All you had to do is say that it was a royal secret. I know what's up. [<i>Walks away from Finn.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I hope you grasp the full consequences of breaking promises.

<b>Finn</b>: Heck yeah! If I break a Royal Promise, I get to fight zombies, throw slumber parties, awake Gumball Guardians and... and...

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Alright, alright.

<b>Finn</b>: <i>[evilly]</i> And reverse death itself!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh, you are adorable. But keep your promises, okay?

<b>Finn</b>: I will, Princess.

[<i>Finn notices Starchie gnawing on his leg and picks him up</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Starchie, you're not a zombie.

<b>Starchie</b>: I can't help it. Flesh is delicious!

<b>Finn</b>: <i>You're</i> delicious!

<b>Starchie</b>:  Don't squeeze me! I'll fart!
