<b>Finn</b>: [<i>knocking on door</i>] Tree Trunks! [<i>opens door and walks in with Jake</i>] [<i>gasps</i>]

[<i>Tree Trunks is lying on the floor next to a broken table, motionless.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>running over to her</i>] Tree Trunks! Tree Trunks?

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>mumbling</i>] Apples... my apples...

<b>Jake</b>: Apples?

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: You! [<i>jumps at Jake</i>] You took my apples! [<i>starts hitting Jake</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Finn... and, and Jake?

<b>Finn</b>: It's okay, Tree Trunks. We're here to help you. Just tell us what happened.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>tearing up</i>] They took 'em. They took all of 'em.

<b>Jake</b>: All of what?

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Apples. My apples that I raised with love from, from mere seedlings. Without my special apples, I won't be able to bake any more apple pies.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: NOOOOOOOO!

<b>Finn</b>: Don't you worry, Tree Trunks. We'll find those thieves and bring them to justice.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Let me show you the crime scene. [<i>leads them outside</i>] You see, boys: scads of apple trees but, but no apples.

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm. Is anything else missing, Tree Trunks?

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: No, Finn, they didn't touch my rocks, or my birds, or my flowers, or, or nothing.

<b>Finn</b>: Hm. Well, I don't see any footprints. What'cha got, Jake?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>patting the air</i>] No <a href="/wiki/Ghosts" title="Ghosts">ghost</a> doodies. Oh. Oh, wait. [<i>feeling something invisible</i>] Oh, no. No.

<b>Finn</b>: Hm. Tree Trunks, is there anyone you can think of who might want to crunk you up?

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, no, Finn. I take great care to assure that-that I'm loved by even the most heinous cretins—

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, guys, I found something! Look!

[<i>Finn and Tree Trunks join Jake at the edge of a hole.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Uh!

<b><a href="/wiki/Raggedy_Princess" title="Raggedy Princess">Raggedy Princess</a></b>: Oh, heheh, hey, Finn. Heheh.

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess. Have you seen anything fishy going on?

<b>Raggedy Princess</b>: Um, no, heheh. I've been kinda down in this hole for a long time. [<i>laughs nervously</i>] I got knocked down here by some ne'er-do-wells. It was terrible. I was so scared.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Ne'er-do-wells? They stole my apples. [<i>flapping ears</i>] I'm gonna sass those boys up nasty!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Awesome. Where do we find these guys?

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, the <a href="/wiki/Candy_Tavern" title="Candy Tavern">Candy Tavern</a>, man. I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>jaw drops with "brring" sound effect</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Don't worry, I stopped doing that a long time ago. I didn't know it was wrong.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>jaw still hanging, with higher "brring" sound effect</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Okay, you two, let's get going.

[<i>Scene changes to outside the Candy Tavern. Someone gets thrown out of the window.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Candy_Tavern_People" title="Candy Tavern People">Candy Tavern Person</a></b>: Whoa!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>gasps</i>] Oh, my!

[<i>The three enter the tavern. A <a href="/wiki/Candy_People" title="Candy People">Candy Person</a> at the bar repeatedly stabs his hand with a spoon, and <a href="/wiki/Cookie_Guy" title="Cookie Guy">an angry cookie</a> shakes.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Uh, does <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a> know about this place?

<b>Jake</b>: Be cool, man. You're gonna queer the deal.

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, yeah. Try not to act suspicious, Tree Trunks.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Okay, I won't.

[<i>The three walk up to the <a href="/wiki/Candy_Tavern_Bartender" title="Candy Tavern Bartender">Candy Tavern Bartender</a>.</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Tree Trunks</b>: Where—?

<b>Finn</b>: Oh. [<i>motions for Tree Trunks to continue</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Where's my dang apples?

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, [<i>laughs</i>] Tree Trunks, you're so silly. But, but listen, you wouldn't happen to have seen any—I don't know—apples around, have you?

<b>Bartender</b>: "Seen any apples?" Y'all ask a lot of dumb-butt questions... almost like you're trying to <i>solve</i> somethin'.

<b>Finn</b>: What? Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.

<b>Bartender</b>: Mmm... clean, too. Almost like some [<i>pounds bar</i>] do-gooders!

<b>Jake</b>: Hold on, we gotta go potty.

[<i>The three enter the bathroom and rub dirt all over their bodies.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Dang. They almost got us, but I think we blend in pretty well now.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>licking toilet paper</i>] This, this toilet paper's drying my mouth all up.

<b>Finn</b>: Uh, Tree Trunks, don't eat that. [<i>sighs</i>] Here. [<i>holds her up to the mirror</i>] [<i>whispers to Jake</i>] You gotta watch her, man!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, I look just like an army brat!

[<i>The three return to the bartender.</i>]

<b>Bartender</b>: What can I do for you?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>pouring drink onto bar</i>] You know where a guy might maybe score some apples? [<i>drops mug onto the floor, shattering it</i>]

<b>Bartender</b>: Well, when you put it like that.... A couple of buddies I know have some apples for sale. I'll show you.

[<i>He leads them to a back door and opens it to <a href="/wiki/Smudge" title="Smudge">a tall gingerbread man</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jaybird" title="Jaybird">an upside-down ice cream cone</a>.</i>]

<b>Bartender</b>: Hey, fellas, these folks been askin' 'bout your... apples?

<b>Jaybird</b>: [<i>scratches chin</i>] Okay, show 'em the apples, Smudge.

[<i>Smudge picks up a trash can and puts it over Jake.</i>]

<b>Jaybird</b>: Grab 'em!

[<i>The bartender grabs Finn and Tree Trunks.</i>]

<b>Jaybird</b>: You go back, and you tell your boss to stop looking for those apples 'cause they're ours now!

<b>Finn</b>: Wha-what boss?

<b>Jaybird</b>: Your boss! <a href="/wiki/Dr._J" title="Dr. J">Dr. J</a>?

<b>Finn</b>: We don't know any Dr. J.

<b>Jaybird</b>: [<i>punches Finn's forehead</i>] Liars! Come on, Smudge [<i>walks off</i>] [<i>mumbling</i>] ...gonna take <i>my</i> apples.

[<i>The bartender drops Finn and Tree Trunks and closes the door. Jake takes the trash can off.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: What just happened?

<b>Finn</b>: I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks' apples also stole Dr. J's apples, and they thought we were workin' for him!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Finn? Finn.

<b>Finn</b>: Hm?

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: This could be dangerous, a-and if you want to go back home, I understand, but I need to do this.

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, Tree Trunks, me too.

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>: Hm?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>pointing to mark</i>] What's that on your face, buddy?

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, that guy bopped me one. Must've had a ring on.

<b>Jake</b>: Y'know, I think I seen that symbol somewhere before. Yeah, right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes.

<b>Finn</b>: What?!

<b>Jake</b>: I didn't know it was wrong.

[<i>Scene changes to the outskirts of the Candy Kingdom.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>points to a building with the mark</i>] Yeah, you see? That guy must work here or somethin'.

[<i>The three walk up to the building.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>knocks on the door</i>] Hello?

<b><a href="/wiki/Wormo" title="Wormo">Wormo</a></b>: [<i>through door</i>] Who's the heck happening? What?

<b>Finn</b>: Uh, we're here about the apples?

<b>Wormo</b>: Oh, okay. Let's see your ring.

<b>Finn</b>: Um...

<b>Jake</b>: Here. [<i>forms a ring on his finger and shows it to Wormo</i>]

<b>Wormo</b>: [<i>opens door</i>] Come on in. Follow this guy. [<i>leads them in</i>]

[<i>Before the door closes, someone stops it with their foot.</i>]

<b>Wormo</b>: [<i>leading them downstairs</i>] My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples. A whole crate. [<i>shows them a crate of diamonds</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What the?

<b>Wormo</b>: What's wrong, guy?

<b>Finn</b>: These aren't apples.

<b>Wormo</b>: Oh, ya didn't mean diamonds? All ne'er-do-wells call diamonds "apples." Like calling money "bread" or rock-knockers "butter-slaps."

<b>Jaybird</b>: [<i>opening door</i>] Hey, Wormo, we're back—what the?! [<i>points to Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks</i>] What are they doing here?

<b>Wormo</b>: They're here for the apples.

<b>Jaybird</b>: That's the dang Dr. J gang, Wormo! Grab 'em!

[<i>Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks are tied up.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Um, sir? [<i>laughs nervously</i>] I promise if you let us go, we won't tell no one about your apples.

<b>Wormo</b>: Feed 'em to <a href="/wiki/Mr._Pig" title="Mr. Pig">the pig</a>.

<b>Smudge</b>: Yeah, the pig.

<b>Jaybird</b>: Heheh, yeah, all right. [<i>walks offscreen and returns carrying Mr. Pig</i>]

<b>Mr. Pig</b>: Uh, I'm sorry, y'all. They're makin' me do this. I-I'll try to make it quick.

<b>Dr. J</b>: Hold it!

[<i>Dr. J and his gang appear.</i>]

<b>Jaybird</b>: Dr. J! [<i>drops pig</i>]

<b>Dr. J</b>: Yeah, yeah, and I want my apples back.

<b>Jaybird &amp; Dr. J</b>:  [<i>in unison</i>] Get 'em, boys!

[<i>While the gangs fight, Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks free themselves from the rope, and Jake brings the pig with them to Tree Trunks' house.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>starts sobbing</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Aw, don't cry, Tree Trunks.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: But we're never gonna find those apples.

<b>Mr. Pig</b>: Apples? You guys looking for apples?

<b>Jake</b>: Uh, yeah, why?

<b>Mr. Pig</b>: 'Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room.

<b>Jake</b>: Wait, you mean "apples" as "diamonds"?

<b>Mr. Pig</b>: No.

<b>Jake</b>: "Apples" as "apples"?

<b>Mr. Pig</b>: Yep.

<b>Finn</b>: You mean apples that we eat?

<b>Mr. Pig</b>: Yes.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: With all due respect, Mr. Pig, sir, my apples were stolen by a dirty, rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail.

<b>Mr. Pig</b>: I'm just telling you the facts, ma'am. What I hear is a whole pigload of apples inside that closet. [<i>points to wardrobe</i>] They sound scared.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Well, I hate to tell you this, boys, but there's no apples in this closet. [<i>sticks tail into keyhole</i>] You see, uh, I'm the only one who knows how to open this closet. [<i>opens it</i>]

[<i>Dozens of apples spill out.</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>gasp</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, so I was the apple thief after all.

<b>Finn</b>: No, Tree Trunks, that's preposterous.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: No, Finn, I'm a criminal, [<i>picks up phone and dials 911</i>] and I need to pay the price.

<b><a href="/wiki/Banana_Guard" title="Banana Guard" class="mw-redirect">Banana Guard</a> [<i>over phone</i>]</b>: Banana Guard speaking.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Uh, this is Tree Trunks. I've done somethin' horrible, and I want you to come over and arrest me.

[<i>Finn and Jake exchange sad looks.</i>]

[<i>Scene changes to outside the house, with Tree Trunks in handcuffs and two Banana Guards standing by.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Tree Trunks, you don't need to do this.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Thank you, Finn and Jake, but I won't let myself slip away from such a terrible crime. Goodbye.

<b>Finn</b>: Tree Trunks.

<b>Banana Guard</b>: Ah, this is hard to watch. I'm gonna look away.

[<i>Several crows fly out of the forest.</i>]

<b>Banana Guard</b>: This place could use a scarecrow.

<b>Finn</b>: Huh? Wait, what'd you say?

<b>Banana Guard</b>: Uh, I-I said this place could use a scarecrow.

<b>Finn</b>: A scarecrow, no footprints, all those magpies on the roof, Raggedy Princess in the ditch, and all the apples in Tree Trunks's closet.

<b>Banana Guard [<i>in Finn's memory</i>]</b>: Boy, this place could use a scarecrow.

<b>Finn</b>: That's it! [<i>climbs onto Tree Trunks' house's roof</i>] I knew it!

[<i>A nest is next to a hole in the roof. A magpie brings an apple to its chicks, but the apple falls into the hole.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole!

<b>Jake</b>: And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree!

<b>Finn</b>: Yes. And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn't sitting on the fence post to scare them off!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Does this mean I'm innocent?

<b>Jake</b>: As innocent as a baby's butt cheek!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>jumps off roof</i>] [<i>laughs</i>] Awesome! This calls for a celebration! You know what that means, Tree Trunks!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: I'ma bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted. [<i>strains and breaks the handcuffs</i>]

<b>Banana Guards</b>: Whoa.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>to Banana Guards</i>] Uh, you boys better stick around if you want a bite of my apple pie. [<i>slaps Banana Guard</i>]

<b>Banana Guard</b>: She slapped my butt!

[<i>The other Banana Guard gives a thumbs up.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>laughs</i>]

[<i>The others join in.</i>]
