<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] 나 정말 TV 걱정되네. 쟤는 밖에 절대 안 나가잖아. (I'm really worried about T.V. You know, he never leaves home.)

<b>Jake</b>: Aw, don't worry about him. It's good to be passionate about your hobbies.

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>: 으유, 몰라, 난 싫어. 쟨 밖에 나가서 찬 공기 좀 쐬야 돼. (Ugh, I don't know, I don't like it. He really needs some fresh air.)

<b>Jake</b>: Yo, T.V.! Get me a chocolate bar!

<b>T.V.</b>: Okay [<i>leaves</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Attaboy!

[<i>Outside, T.V. is walking along a path.</i>]

<b>T.V.</b>: Ah!

<b>Old Pizza Person</b>: Hello, young man!

[<i>T.V. teleports away.</i>]

<b>Old Pizza Person</b>: [<i>disappointed</i>] Oh.

<b>T.V.</b>: [<i>approaching Candy Kingdom</i>] Psych. Delicious chocolate bridge... [<i>pulls out a brick</i>] Ugh! [<i>falls in chocolate puddle</i>] Yuch. Huh?

[<i>In front of him is a book in a sealed plastic bag with "Diary" written on the cover. T.V. takes the book out of its bag and opens it to the first page.</i>]

<b>T.V.</b>: [<i>reading</i>] This diary belongs to B.P. Private property. [<i>turns page</i>] If you're stilling reading this, you're a bad person. [<i>stops reading</i>] Uh... statute of limitations. [<i>continues reading</i>]

<b>B.P. [<i>voiceover</i>]</b>: Dear diary. Wow. I sound like a real cornball. Oh, well. Dear diary! Mom is going to love you. She's always ragging about me spending too much time with my nose in books. I wonder what I'm going to write in you. What kind of person will I be when I get to your last page? Will I have my braces off? Will I have written a song that doesn't totally suck? Will I have met a cool guy? I can barely look at dudes without breaking out into hives. Just another day in teenage purgatory, AKA the school caf. Sloppy joes again. Boys I did not talk to today—Brownieguy... are they trying to kill us? Stayed in and tried to cut my bangs... Ruffles, Brian, Pennycandy guy... Mom says it looks like I got in a fight with a snapping turtle. Taffi and Mochi are the coolest girls at school. When I think about them, my skin feels sparkly. They don't even know I exist. Why would they? I'm a nobody. Less than nobody. I'm a pimple on the butt of a—

<b>T.V.</b>: Geez, B.P... Prone to dramatics much?

<b>B.P. [<i>voiceover</i>]</b>: The <a href="/wiki/Fire_Kingdom" title="Fire Kingdom">Fire Kingdom</a> has officially frozen over. <a href="/wiki/Justin_Rockcandy" title="Justin Rockcandy">Justin Rockcandy</a> asked me to the semi-formal!

<b>T.V.</b>: Oh, my <a href="/wiki/Grob_Gob_Glob_Grod" title="Grob Gob Glob Grod">glob</a>.

<b>B.P. [<i>voiceover</i>]</b>: Just... Justin is taking me to the Fructose Fair... Justin... Justin wants to go on the rollercoas... Kissing is fun and easy. If I don't think about the bacteria and spit, teeming, multiplying... Diary, can you keep a secret?... Justin!... Justin... hive of bees in my head, get out... Mother, I'm not going to tell you again... Diary, it's my birthday tomorrow, but I don't feel like celebrating. I feel like screaming. [<i>turns page</i>] Justin wants to meet at Lovetree Point. Says he wants to give me a present. I should tell him; I need to tell him. I will tell him!

<b>T.V.</b>:  [<i>Gasps, sees the next five pages torn out</i>] Tell him what? Uuuuuugh!

[<i>Morning now, scene opens on Lady Rainicorn making eggs, wearing a white apron. Jake is sitting at the table.</i>]

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>: (TV! Breakfast!)

<b>T.V.</b>: Not huns. [<i>grabs an apple from a bowl on the counter</i>] Heading out for a bit.

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>: (Look at him!)

<b>Jake</b>: There you go, just need a little push from the old man. [<i>coughs</i>]

<b>T.V.</b>: [<i>Returns to place where he found the diary under the chocolate bridge.</i>] I gotta get into the mind of this kid. [<i>opens diary</i>] Roleplay. [<i>pretends he is B.P., starts pretending to rip pages out of diary</i>] Rip, rip! [<i>pretends to throw diary</i>] Ahh! Sploosh! My secret is safe at the bottom of this disgusting moat. [<i>turns around, pretending to be another person talking to B.P.] Oh, B.P., what have you done? [</i>as B.P.<i>] I'm sick of the lies. Sick, sick, sick!</i> [<i>a candy child and their parent start to watch T.V.'s roleplaying from the bridge for a second, and then the parent pulls the child along. T.V. as other person</i>] Uh, babe, I said I'm sorry? [<i>as B.P.</i>] You don't know me. Nobody knows me, leave me alone! [<i>The rose on the front of the diary flies away, and the diary turns into a Sloppy Joe.</i>] I hate Sloppy Joes!

[<i>The scenery around T.V. washes away and shows him sitting on a graffitied rollercoaster marked "BP." The rollercoaster flies off a ramp and falls into a moat with a chocolate bridge above it. T.V. surfaces, gasping for air.</i>

<b>T.V.</b>: Yuck.
