[<i>The episode begins at the <a href="/wiki/Tree_Fort" title="Tree Fort">Tree Fort</a>. The camera pans to the bridge linking the living room and attic.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] Ahhh... YEAH!!! [<i>Busts through living room door and lands on bridge.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></b>:  [<i>Entering</i>] Heh heh. [<i>Deep voice</i>] Aw, yeah. [<i>Chuckles</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls. [<i>Slaps Jake's nose; Jake does a snorting laugh</i>] Seriously, though... get ready... for a day filled with adventure!

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa, really?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, man!! [<i>He slaps Jake's nose again, making him snort and laugh again</i>] I wrote on my arm this to-do list of cool junk. [<i>The clouds begin to get darker and bigger</i>] Number one: back flip off this bridge and do the splits. Number two: track down and slay a goblin horde. Number three...[<i>Glances up at thundering clouds</i>] storm clouds?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Examining</i>] Hmmm... [<i>Knives fall from the clouds and Jake gasps.</i>] Finn... it's a knife storm!! [<i>Finn slaps Jake's nose yet again</i>] It's raining knives, man! Come on! [<i>Exits</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I've never seen a <a href="/wiki/Knife_storm" title="Knife storm" class="mw-redirect">knife storm</a> before... It's beautiful.

[<i>Knives begin falling near Finn; Jake pulls Finn inside before knives can fall on him.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid.

<b>Finn</b>:  Well, what're we gonna do?

<b><a href="/wiki/BMO" title="BMO">BMO</a></b>:  Who wants to play video games??

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  BMO!!

<b>Jake</b>:  What's on the menu, BMO?

<b>BMO</b>:  I've created a new game called <a href="/wiki/Conversation_Parade" title="Conversation Parade">Conversation Parade</a>.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hah! Alright!

<b>Jake</b>:  Start it up, BMO!

<b>BMO</b>:  [singing] What do you think about the stars in the sky?

<b>Finn</b>:  'S okay, I guess.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, they're cool.

<b>BMO</b>:  That is an interesting response! Battery low... Shut doooowwwwn...

<b>Finn</b>:  Booooo.

<b>Jake</b>:  BMO, that was weak.

<b>Finn</b>:  What now?

<b>Jake</b>:  Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do!

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa! What?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Let's use our imaginations, man!

<b>Finn</b>:  Barf that! Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is! I'm a kick-butt reality master!! I would rather die than be imaginative. I mean that.

<b>Jake</b>:  Eh. Your loss. [<i>Beat</i>] AAAH!!! Lava!! Lava all around us!! [<i>Panicking and jumping around</i>] Lava on the floor!

<b>Finn</b>:  Shut up, man...

<b>Jake</b>:  Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'!

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality. [<i>Moves his foot nearer and nearer to the floor</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  NOOOOO!!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Places foot on floor; it suddenly catches fire</i>] AAAAH!!! [<i>Putting fire out</i>] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?!

<b>Jake</b>:  I was just playin' around with my imagination... [<i>In Jake's view, everything is on fire and lava is on the floor</i>] ...and then everything got intense.

<b>Finn</b>:  It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To himself</i>] Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs...

<b>Finn</b>:  Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries.

[<i>Everything in the room begins to melt.</i>]

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  WHOA!

<b>Finn</b>:  But first stop imagining lava!

<b>Jake</b>:  I can't! My imagination's too amazing!

<b>Finn</b>:  Imagine turning your imagination off!

<b>Jake</b>:  I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an <a href="/wiki/Imagination_machine" title="Imagination machine">imagination turning-off machine</a>... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters.

<b>Finn</b>:  Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?

<b>Jake</b>:  You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma!

<b>Finn</b>:  Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up!

<b>Jake</b>:  Neat! [<i>Finn and he enter the den</i>] Grab that missile.

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay.

<b>Jake</b>:  And... get that <a href="/wiki/Cosmic_gauntlet" title="Cosmic gauntlet" class="mw-redirect">cosmic gauntlet</a>.

<b>Finn</b>:  Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH! [<i>Finn leaps into an invisible wall.</i>] What did I just hit?!

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it.

<b>Finn</b>:  Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, there's one now. [<i>Troll roars</i>] Look out!

<b>Finn</b>:  Aah! I can feel it on my foot! [<i>They stumble over, and Finn's shoe seemingly floats in midair.</i>] I'll kill you, troll! Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah!

<b>Jake</b>:  You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you!

<b>Finn</b>:  Yah, yah! [<i>Finn's blows finally start to land.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Alright! You're gettin' him, man! [Finn continues attacking] Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family. [<i>Finn kicks in the air and a scream is heard.</i>] Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face! [<i>Troll wife yells incomprehensibly.</i>] She's comin' back for revenge.

<b>Finn</b>:  Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah!

[Finn leaps out the window into the knife storm.]

<b>Jake</b>:  The knife storm, remember?!?! [<i>Finn frantically pulls himself and Jake up to the attic. They rest and pant heavily.</i>] Oh, boy... Ooh... Finn, I found some candy. [<i>Eats some</i>] It tastes like banana candy, man. [<i>Sips drink</i>] Here, man. Try some.

[<i>Finn eats some candy.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Standing up</i>] Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed.

<b>Jake</b>:  Okay! [<i>Does it</i>] It is done.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Walks out cautiously</i>] Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man!

<b><a href="/wiki/Riddle_Master" title="Riddle Master">Riddle Master</a></b>:  No, voyagers. To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To Jake</i>] An imaginary riddle master?

[<i>Jake laughs sillily.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Sighs</i>] Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test.

<b>Riddle Master</b>:  Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Ready</i>] LAY IT ON ME!!

<b>Riddle Master</b>:  Yes, um... The riddle, uh... It... cometh... uh...

<b>Jake</b>:  I can't imagine a riddle.

<b>Finn</b>:  Dude, just make it super easy.

<b>Riddle Master</b>:  THE RIDDLE COMETH! Tell me, voyager. What is simple, and yet also... a riddle?

<b>Finn</b>:  Man, that riddle sucks.

<b>Riddle Master</b>:  THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!! The penalty is... DEATH BY SNAKES!!

<b>Finn</b>:  YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!

[<i>Finn launches it and it explodes on the other side of the bridge. Finn and Jake scream in pain.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  You exploded the snakes right at us!!

<b>Finn</b>:  I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry!

<b>Finn</b>:  Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!

<b>Jake</b>: AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!! [<i>Finn evades the obstacle.</i>] Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck! [<i>Finn jumps up and does so. A weapon is heard charging up. Jake gasps.</i>] The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!

[<i>Bazooka Goblin laughs.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Don't you do it...

[<i>Bazooka Goblin continues laughing.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  DON'T DO IT, MAN!!!

<b>Bazooka Goblin</b>:  Hee... heehee... hee... Okay.

<b>Jake</b>:  YEAH!

<b>Finn</b>:  AW, YEAH!

[Finn and Jake laugh and do a celebratory fist bump.]

<b>Finn</b>:  Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me.

<b>Jake</b>:  Alright. Goin' up. Check it. My imagination-off machine is left of the bed.

<b>Finn</b>:  Is it clear?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you.

[<i>Finn fidgets around and mumbles to himself ("Ah... where, ah... Where is this, I ca—Ah... man.") before finding the machine.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh! I found the shut-off lever!

<b>Jake</b>:  Cool, man! [<i>Invisible girl giggles.</i>] Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby. [<i>Another girl giggles.</i>] What're you laughin' at?

<b>Finn</b>:  Alright. I'm gonna turn it off. [<i>Finn is suddenly hit by an invisible force.</i>] UNH!! You said it was clear of danger!!

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!!

<b>Finn</b>:  What?! Well, how do I kill it?! [<i>Finn gets beaten down.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this! [<i>Punches it</i>] Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever!

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!! [<i>Finn pulls the lever; Jake falls down; Finn's wounds are healed.</i>] Aw, yeah! The imaginary poison is gone, Jake! Jake? [<i>Jake groans.</i>] Hey, come on. Wake up, man.

[<i>Finn pats Jake a few times.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Completely regular tone</i>] Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy.

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality?

<b>Jake</b>:  I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic.

<b>Finn</b>:  Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing!

<b>Jake</b>:  But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you.

<b>Finn</b>:  Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing. [<i>Sighs</i>]

[<i>Jake reaches for his viola and plays a continuous G♮</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note.

<b>Jake</b>:  One note is all that is needed.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Scoffs</i>] I'm gonna turn your imagination back on. [<i>Fidgets around and mumbles to self</i>] Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!

<b>Jake</b>:  True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?

<b>Finn</b>:  I remembereth.

<b>Jake</b>:  I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless.

<b>Finn</b>:  No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now... [<i>Saddened</i>] ...only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go... [<i>Finn appears in his imagination land.</i>] What the stuff? Well... this isn't so bad. [<i>Imagination back-on machine appears</i>] Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!

[<i>Suddenly, the <a href="/wiki/Lyre_Player" title="Lyre Player">Lyre Player</a> enters dancing and singing the Imagination Song.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Disappointed</i>] Cram. Oh! Maybe I can try imagining something. [<i>He imagines a penguin, and a bowl of spaghetti. The Lyre Player trips over the former and lands in the latter; Finn laughs.</i>] Now for that switch.

<b><a href="/wiki/Bellamy_Bug" title="Bellamy Bug">Bellamy Bug</a></b>:  [<i>Entering</i>] Good morrow, sir! My name is Bellamy Bug! Would you care for a crotchet doily my daughter made? She imbued it with her tears. You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy.

<b>Finn</b>:  No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!

<b>Bellamy Bug</b>:  [<i>Giggles</i>] I don't know, my young fellow! You tell me. Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized!

<b>Finn</b>:  REPRESENT THIS! [<i>Smacks Bellamy</i>] And this. [<i>Imagines two arms protruding out of Bellamy (one cephalopodic and one robotic) which both punch him.</i>]

<b>Bellamy</b>:  Oh! I say! Oh! Ah! Ouch! Ah!

[<i>Penguins take Bellamy away.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright. [<i>Runs over to the machine</i>] I hope this works, Jake! [<i>Pulls lever; Jake's imagination returns.</i>] Haha, yeah! [<i>A fairy comes near the machine giggling.</i>] Hey! Get away from that! Don't push that hyper drive button! [<i>The fairy does.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake's head grows rapidly</i>] Aaaah!! I can imagine EVERYTHING!!!

<b>Finn</b>:  <i>[Frustrated sigh</i>] Take a hike, fairy! Normal style! [Pushes "NORMAL STYLE" button]

<b>Jake</b>:  [Head shrinks] Aw, man... I imagined my <a href="/wiki/Margaret" title="Margaret">mom</a> naked! [<i>Finn appears next to him.</i>] Yugh!

<b>Finn</b>:  You okay?

<b>Jake</b>:  I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure!

<b>Finn</b>:  I don't know, dude. I think we got all the adventure we need right here... [<i>Thinking</i>] with... lava on the floor!

<b>Jake</b>:  Huh?! [<i>Body starts melting</i>] AAH! AAH! MY LEGS ARE MELTING! Just kidding. [<i>Chuckles and reforms his body.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hahahaha! Good dog. [<i>He pets Jake, and the episode ends.</i>]
