<b>Finn [<i>Davey</i>]</b>:  Hello! Ahem, hello, hello, helloo...... ahhhhhHHH [<i>His voice scales through several autotuned octaves</i>] [<i>Davey's voice</i>] Hello! I'm Davey!

[<i>The Candy People get disappointed and go sit in front of the treefort and wait for Finn.</i>]

<b>Randy</b>:  Oh, I thought it was Finn on account of he's wearing Finn's exact clothes.

<b>Davey</b>:  [<i>running through the Candy Kingdom</i>] Hi! I'm Davey!

[<i>At the treehouse in Finn and Jake's bedroom</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Takes off his mustache</i>] Man, today was awesome. Just normal, y'know? Just like a normal day. No drama, or any of that. Just super normal. Man it was great.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>While lying in his bed</i>] That's cool. Goodnight, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Puts on his mustache</i>] I'm Davey.

<b>Jake</b>:  Haha! Yeah.

<b>Davey</b>:  I'm Davey! [<i>Eyes turn big.</i>]

[<i>In the morning, sounds of wood being chopped is coming from outside</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Wakes up</i>] Hey, Finn, you wanna have dinner instead of breakfast today? Finn? [<i>Wiggles his ears</i>] That must be him. [<i>Gets up and goes to the door</i>]

[<i>The Candy People are outside</i>]

<b>Candy Person #1</b>:  I MADE YOU DINNER, FINN! WHERE WERE YOU?!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Opens the front door. Walks up to Davey</i>] Uhh.... What's going on?

<b>Davey</b>:  Oh, heya, mister, thanks for putting me up last night. I'm just chopping some wood so's I can build a little log cabin to live in.

[<i>Jake gets shocked</i>]

<b>Randy</b>:  [<i>Walks up to the scene and grabs the chopped wood</i>] Hey, I'm Randy.

<b>Davey</b>:  Randy, wanna get dinner tonight?

<b>Randy</b>:  Nah, I'm busy. I like to wonder at night.

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn what's going on?

<b>Davey</b>:  [<i>Takes Jake to the other side of the half-built cabin. So he can talk to him in private</i>] You gotta start calling me Davey, mister. Because that's my name!

[<i>Jake stands still, staring at "Davey"</i>]

<b>Davey</b>:  [<i>Large-eyed</i>] Daaaaaaaaaavvvveeeeeeyyyyyy!!!

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, no! Have you lost your teacups, man?

<b>Davey</b>:  Mister, I don't know nothing about that. I'm just a working joe... trying to stake my claim... under the sun... and look out on the beautiful green fields called... life!

<b>Jake</b>:  Uhhhhhhhh........

<b>Randy</b>:  Hey, Davey, where do you want these logs?

<b>Davey</b>:  Oh, just attach 'em to the cabin. Like how it should be. So it looks like a cabin. We're gonna build a right wall and front wall. Ummmmm-

<b>Randy</b>:  How about the roof?

<b>Davey</b>:  Maybe, maybe.

<b>Randy</b>:  I've been holding these.

<b>Davey</b>:  They look good.

<b>Randy</b>:  How do you put good looking wood on a cabin?

<b>Jake</b>:  Gotta figure a way to get Finn to act normal. [<i>Then he sees BMO running in circles dressed as a robber</i>]

<b>BMO</b>:  <i>Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pewwww.....</i>

[<i>Randy and Davey are sitting on rocking chairs in front of the cabin and drinking soda while Jake comes in a robber costume</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Ah! Give me the wallet! Or feel my claw! The wallet!

<b>BMO</b>:  Watch out! A robber!

<b>Jake</b>:  I'll cut you! I mean, rob you! [<i>Takes randy as a hostage</i>]

<b>Davey</b>:  Oh, no!

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm a robber and I'm gonna rob this guy's life! And there's nobody who can stop me. Unless there's a hero around here. [<i>In a suggestive tone</i>] Like there's someone here who is actually a <i>hero</i> in <i>disguise</i>. They can probably stop me. [<i>Runs up to Davey and whispers</i>] C'mon, Finn. Be a hero.

<b>Randy</b>:  What? What are we talking about?

<b>Jake</b>:  Butt out, Randy!

<b>Randy</b>:  [<i>While being pulled back</i>] Uhhhhhhhhhhhh.........

[<i>Davey goes into the cabin</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Whispers.</i>] Yes, Finn. Put on your awesome hat and beat me up.

<b>Randy</b>:  What?

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm not talking to you, Randy!

<b>Davey</b>:  [<i>Comes out of the cabin</i>] I called the police.

<b>Jake</b>:  Wait, what?

[<i>In the next scene, the banana guards are dragging Jake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Guys, it's not what it looks like! That guy isn't really named Davey. It's Finn! He brainwashed himself to become Davey and I was just trying to inspire him to go back to being Finn.

<b>Banana Guards</b>:  Yeah, yeah. We've heard that before. C'mon robber!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Shouts to Davey.</i>] Finn, don't let the dragon drag on, man. Don't let the dragon drag on!

<b>Davey</b>:  [<i>In Finn's voice</i>] Don't let the dragon........ Jake!

<b>Randy</b>:  [<i>While drinking his soda and sitting on the rocking chair</i>] Well that was pretty unusual, wasn't it, Davey?

<b>Davey</b>:  Get outta here Randy! [<i>In an exasperated tone and angry expression</i>] Geeeet ouuuuut! [<i>Hits a glass against the wall</i>]

[<i>Randy shrugs and walks off.</i>]

<b>Davey</b>:  [<i>Takes off his mustache and starts talking to it</i>] No more Davey.

<b>Mustache</b>:  But you love being Davey.

<b>Finn</b>:  I do love being Davey, but being Davey caused Jake to get arrested.

<b>Mustache</b>:  But remember that time when Davey sat in the park and saw some people walking around?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, that was nice.

<b>Mustache</b>:  And remember that time when Davey swept the floors?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Chuckles</i>] Yeah, that was great, too. But-

<b>Mustache</b>:  Do you really wanna go back to being a famous hero? Why not just be Davey? A simple man... with simple goals and simple problems. You can just blend in and live the simple life.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah.... Blend in. Y'know, maybe I'll be Davey just one more time! [<i>Puts the mustache on</i>]

<b>Davey</b>:  One more time!

[<i>Banana Guards are deciding what to do while guarding the prisoners</i>]

<b>Banana Guard #1</b>:  C'mon, man! That last game wasn't fair.

<b>Banana Guard #2</b>:  How about: Who can hold up their hand the longest?

<b>Banana Guard #1</b>:  Okay, this game breaks the tie.

<b>Banana Guard #2</b>:  Okay.

<b>Banana Guard #1</b>:  Last game.

<b>Banana Guard #2</b>:  Last game.

[<i>They both hold up their hands while Davey comes in and sweeps the floor</i>]

<b>Davey</b>:  Hey, fellas. How's tricks?

<b>Banana Guard #2</b>:  Hm? Oh, hey Davey.

<b>Davey</b>:  [<i>Goes next to Banana Guard #2 and whispers to himself</i>] Ah! Keys! [<i>Touches the key with his broom</i>]

<b>Banana Guard #2</b>:  Hm? [<i>Starts shivering</i>] What's going on?

<b>Davey</b>:  Ah. Would you care for a body sweep?

<b>Banana Guard #2</b>:  Umm... yeah... sure. I do feel kinda dirty.

[<i>Davey starts sweeping Banana Guard #2's body</i>]

<b>Banana Guard #1</b>:  Whew! You sure know how to party, Davey! [<i>The guards are struggling to hold their arms up</i>]

<b>Davey</b>:  [<i>Knocks the keys into his pocket with the broom</i>]

<b>Banana Guard #2</b>:  [<i>Cheers because he's winning</i>] Yes yes yes!

<b>Banana Guard #1</b>:  No no no!

<b>Davey</b>:  [<i>Walks up to Jake's prison while the banana guards are distracted. He opens Jake's prison door open with the key</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Davey?!

[<i>Davey takes off his mustache</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  No, it's me, [<i>Finn's eyes grow big</i>] Finn!

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn! [<i>Walks up to Finn</i>]

<b>Banana Guard #2</b>:  [<i>Comes to Jake's prison</i>] Here's your meal, criminal. We feed our criminals. [<i>Realizes the prisoner is free. Drops the meal</i>] Hey, stop!

[<i>Finn and Jake run out of the prison with the guards following behind</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Puts Jake's robber clothes on a candy horse and sticks his mustache to the back of the horse. He takes his hat out and puts it on, then waves to the mustache</i>] Goodbye, Davey.

<b>Mustache [<i>Davey</i>]</b>:  Goodbye, Finn.

[<i>Finn slaps the horses butt and the horse starts running. Then the Banana Guards come.</i>]

<b>Banana Guard #2</b>:  Hey, there they go!

<b>Banana Guard #1</b>:  Yeah, there goes Davey and the criminal.

[<i>They both see Finn</i>] Oh, hey, Finn! [<i>They start following Davey and the criminal</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Good luck catching those guys!

<b>Banana Guard #2</b>:  [<i>Shouts out to Finn</i>] Thanks!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>In Finn's pocket</i>] Glad to have you back, buddy.

<b>Finn</b>:  Word.

[<i>Jake turns his back and farts and the episode ends.</i>]
