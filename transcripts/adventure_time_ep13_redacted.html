[<i>The episode begins with a <a href="/wiki/Frog_Carrying_Crown" title="Frog Carrying Crown">frog carrying a crown</a> walking with <a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a> following behind.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude... how long are we gonna follow this frog?

<b>Finn</b>:  I just wanna see 'im put on that crown.

[<i>The frog walks through the bars of a locked gate.</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Running towards the gate</i>] Wooow!

<b>Jake</b>:  It looks cool in <a href="/wiki/Witch%27s_garden_(location)" title="Witch's garden (location)" class="mw-redirect">there</a>!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Pointing to lock on gate</i>] Too bad we don't have the key to <i>this</i>.

<b>Jake</b>:  What're you talkin' about? [<i>Indicating his legs</i>] I got two keys right here!

[<i>Finn laughs and gets on Jake's back. Jake stretches over the wall of the garden.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoo-hoo!

[<i>Finn and Jake land inside the garden.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Wow! Look at this place!

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake. Are these donuts?

<b>Jake</b>:  They <i>look</i> like donuts.

<b>Finn</b>:  But maybe they're <i>poisonous</i> donuts! [<i>Jake begins sniffing one of the donuts on the bush.</i>] Yeah! Sniff it, Jake! Suck up those toxins!

[<i>Jake sniffs it thoroughly.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Wait a second... I don't know what poison smells like.

<b><a href="/wiki/Witch" title="Witch">Witch</a></b>:  Hey! [<i>She strains towards Finn and Jake on her cane.</i>] [<i>Lifting her cane</i>] <a href="/wiki/Razzamafoo" title="Razzamafoo">Razzamafoo</a>!

[<i>She switches places with Finn and Jake.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey!

<b>Finn</b>:  What gives?!

<b>Witch</b>:  You ate one of my donuts!

<b>Jake</b>:  No, I didn't. I just sniffed it.

<b>Witch</b>:  RAAAAAGH!! You're <i>lying</i>! The stink of magic dog lips is everywhere!

<b>Finn</b>:  Holy slug, lady! Calm down!

<b>Jake</b>:  Listen, Mrs. Witch.

<b>Witch</b>:  I never married!

<b>Jake</b>:  Well, <i>I</i> never ate your donuts.

<b>Witch</b>:  You... you're <i>eating</i> one right <i>now</i>!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Mouth full</i>] No, I'm not! [<i>Noticing he is holding a donut</i>] Whoa-hoa! Hm... That's weird... I don't even remember <i>grabbing</i> this. My subconscious must be hungry, huh? Huh... whatever. [<i>Finishes donut</i>]

<b>Witch</b>:  [<i>Convulses angrily</i>] MAGICUS NOMORICUS!

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh-oh. [<i>Gets blasted</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  AAH! [<i>The magic smoke makes him and Jake cough.</i>] Dude, are you okay?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah... I think so. Just a little chilly. [<i>Noticing he is in his underwear</i>] WHOA!

<b>Witch</b>:  Ahahahahahehehe!

<b>Finn</b>:  What did she <i>do</i> to you?

<b>Witch</b>:  I stripped him of his magical powers!

<b>Finn</b>:  For stealing one of your <i>billions</i> of donuts?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, it's not like I killed your husband or somethin'.

<b>Witch</b>:  [<i>Livid</i>] I AM NOT <i>MARRIED</i>!

<b>Finn</b>:  The point is you overreacted.

<b>Jake</b>:  And what gives? [<i>Pointing to his nipple</i>] I used to have like eight more of these things.

<b>Witch</b>:  The only way I'll give back your powers is if you admit your error and say you're sorry and <i>mean it</i>! ...'Cause I can tell the difference.

<b>Jake</b>:  Well, you can forget it because <i>you're</i> the one who's wrong! [<i>To Finn</i>] ...Right?

<b>Finn</b>:  Total support, dude.

<b>Witch</b>:  [<i>Convulsing angrily</i>] RRRRAAAARRGH!! [<i>Waving her cane</i>] Go-backicus-from-whence-you-came-icus!

<b>Finn</b>:  Aw, now you're just makin' these up!

[<i>He and Jake disappear.</i>]

<b>Witch</b>:  [<i>Rubbing one of the donuts</i>] Are you alright, my... my donut pretties? Heh heh... Wait a second. YOU'RE A <i><a href="/wiki/Bagel" title="Bagel">BAGEL</a></i>! LIARS! LIARS EVERYWHERE! [<i>The bagel becomes "stripped." Scene shifts to the <a href="/wiki/Tree_Fort" title="Tree Fort">Tree Fort</a>.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  There's gotta be a way to get your powers back! Where'd they come from, anyway? Were you born with them? Or... did you have a freak industrial accident?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Ha. That takes me back. Let me just... [<i>deep voice</i>] remember. [<i>A memory bubble appears above his head.</i>] I see a memory. When I was just a pupster... I'm rollin' around in a mud puddle, and I'm just... lovin's it. Oh, no! [<i>The bubble explodes. Jake pants from exhaustion.</i>] Whoo... Remembering is hard work.

<b>Finn</b>:  What happened next?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh. Um... I went into the mud, and... I <i>guess</i> I became a magic dog?

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay! Then our course is clear! We'll roll you in every mud puddle in <a href="/wiki/Land_of_Ooo" title="Land of Ooo">Ooo</a> until we find the one that'll restore your powers.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Lying down</i>] That's nuts, man. You got any idea of how many mud puddles are in the land of Ooo? <i>Four</i>? Maybe even <i>five</i>?

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, come on! We've always been lucky, buddy! Maybe the first mud puddle we find will be the right one!

<b>Jake</b>:  Nonsense... but I like it!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Jumping out window</i>] Then away! Hyuh! Whoo-hoo!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, let's do it!

[<i>Finn lands on his feet; Jake lands on his face with a thud.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, my gosh!

<b>Jake</b>:  I forgot that I don't have magic powers anymore. How do we search for the mud without my powers?

<b>Finn</b>:  We run! Run like energetic little boys! [<i>Finn runs quickly away.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To himself</i>] This whole time, I thought running was some sort of... <i>leg</i> magic. [<i>Jake begins trudging along. Before long, he gets tired.</i>] Huh... Look at me. I'm runnin'! [<i>Pants heavily; the camera gets ahead of him as he slows down.</i>] Oh, no... [<i>Thud; camera pans back to Jake.</i>] [<i>Out of breath</i>] Running... is... evil...

<b>Finn</b>:  Come on, lazy bones!

<b>Jake</b>:  It's too hard!

<b>Finn</b>:  I guess you <i>could</i> ride on my backpack.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Straining</i>] I can't reach. [<i>Finn bends backwards; Jake grabs on to Finn's neck.</i>] You good, Finn?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Choking</i>] You're... strangling me... a little, is all.

[<i>Scene transition to the <a href="/wiki/River_of_Junk" title="River of Junk">River of Junk</a>.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Look there! Across the River of Junk! There's an ideal mud puddle.

<b>Jake</b>:  I'll stretch into a boat! [<i>Strains then farts</i>] I'm startin' to <i>really miss</i> that old magic of mine.

<b>Finn</b>:  We can swim this river easy! [<i>Jumps into river</i>] Come on, Jake! [<i>Swims across, leaving Jake behind</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To himself</i>] Man, that looks exhausting.

[<i>A projection of Jake's subconscious appears on a piece of furniture in the river.</i>]

<b>Jake's subconscious</b>: You're right, Jake. It <i>is</i> exhausting.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Gasp</i>] What <i>are</i> you?!

<b>Jake's subconscious</b>:  I'm your subconscious!

<b>Jake</b>:  Okay, what are you <i>doing</i> here?

<b>Jake's subconscious</b>:  I'm here to tell you that what you're feeling deep down inside is true! It <i>is</i> way too hard to swim across the river. It's easier to wear a hat. [<i>Handing Jake a hat</i>] Here! Have a hat!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Donning the hat</i>] Ha ha!

<b>Jake &amp; his subconscious</b>:  Yeah-hea-hea-hea! Heh heh!

<b>Jake</b>:  Man, I'm glad I met you.

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake! Stop talking to yourself! Cross over already!

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh, I can't swim that river, dude. My subconscious says it's too hard. Check out this hat, though.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Growls</i>] What's <i>wrong</i> with that guy? [<i>To Jake</i>] Then just wait for me there!

[<i>Finn dives down and begins gathering various things. When he grabs a trash can lid, a large eye is uncovered and it opens. Finn re-surfaces and begins building something, mumbling to himself and visibly annoyed. "Ergh, stupid..."</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Whatcha workin' on, Finn? [<i>Finn continues constructing a catapult from the junk, still mumbling angrily to himself. "... have to do everything!"</i>] Look at you! Doin' stuff! [<i>Finn pulls down the catapult lever.</i>] Oh, is it a chair? [<i>Jake gets on the platform.</i>] A chair for my butt—? [<i>Finn releases the lever, launching Jake all the way to the other side of the river and into the mud puddle.</i>] Mud-venture!

<b>Finn</b>:  Did it work?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, yeah! I can feel this workin'! In fact, <i>you</i> should roll in the mud <i>with</i> me, Finn! We can <i>both</i> be magic!

<b>Finn</b>:  YEAAAAH! [<i>Joins Jake in the mud. They laugh and roll around in it.</i>] This isn't working at all.

<b>Jake</b>:  This isn't the right mud. I was just really hopin' this was over and done.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Sigh</i>] Okay... Then let's just go find another mud puddle.

<b>Jake</b>:  Actually... I'm feeling kinda chubby-tired. Can't we do this tomorrow?

<b>Finn</b>:  Agh! This is stupid! Just go back to the witch and apologize and get your powers back!

<b>Jake</b>:  Never! I'd rather be powerless forever then apologize! I'm lazy but prideful.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Angrily</i>] YOU'RE NOT EVEN <i>TRYING</i>, MAN! [<i>Knocks Jake's hat off</i>] First, you won't run, [<i>Stuttering</i>] a-and now you keep—and... a-and no matter what, I ju—you...

<b>Jake</b>:  Adventuring is too much hard work for a bro without his powers.

<b>Finn</b>:  But you <i>are</i> an adventurer.

<b>Jake</b>:  Nah, from now on, I'm just your regular old dog. ...Ironic given my current man-baby body.

[<i>Something big emerges from the river; Finn and Jake gasp. A giant pile of junk emerges and a <a href="/wiki/Gary_the_Mermaid_Queen" title="Gary the Mermaid Queen">giant living fish skeleton</a> pops out of it.</i>]

<b>Gary</b>:  Behold the beautiful mermaid of the river. [<i>Finn retches.</i>] Which one of you mortals wants to mate with [<i>Gesturing over her body</i>] all <i>this</i>? Heh heh heh...

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, um... How do I say, "You're the grossest thing ever," without offending you?

<b>Gary</b>:  RAAAAAARGH!!

[<i>Gary angrily conjures up a fireball.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  I'll scare her off, Finn! [<i>Barks at her</i>]

[<i>Gary blasts them but they evade.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  How do we beat power like <i>that</i>?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn! I've got an idea!

<b>Finn</b>:  What is it, buddy??

<b>Jake</b>:  Rub my belly! Yeah, I'm one of <i>those</i> kinda dogs.

[<i>Finn growls angrily.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Charging Gary</i>] YAAAAH!

[<i>Gary evades his attack and spits a black substance on him, knocking him out. Gary cackles.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn? [<i>Gary takes him to her nest.</i>] Finn! Come on, Finn! You gotta save yourself! I'm just a dog! Aw, man. Oh, geez... Okay. Then I'm back on the team! [<i>Attempts to climb tree</i>] I'll save you!

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake? [<i>Giant eggs around him are beginning to hatch.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Don't worry! [<i>He fails to climb the tree.</i>] Hey, Finn... Can you help me to get up there?

[<i>The <a href="/wiki/Hatchlings" title="Hatchlings">Hatchlings</a> hatch.</i>]

<b>Hatchlings</b>:  Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Desperate noise</i>] If only I had my powers back!

<b>Witch [<i>In Jake's memory</i>]</b>:  The only way I'll give back your powers is if—

<b>Jake</b>:  I know, I know! I have to apologize to that Witch.

[<i>Scene transition to the Witch's garden. The Witch is planting a cupcake.</i>]

<b>Witch</b>:  [<i>To cupcake</i>] Oh, you're doing so well... and I hate you so much!!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>At gate</i>] Hey! [<i>He's straining to get past the gate, but he's too fat.</i>] Witch! I need my powers back! So I'm sorry! I'm so sorry I ate your donut!

<b>Witch</b>:  Razzamafoo.

[<i>Jake appears in front of the Witch.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Straining sounds</i>] ...Oh. [<i>Stops straining</i>] So do I get my powers back?!

<b>Witch</b>:  Mmm... Apology <i>denied</i>.

<b>Jake</b>:  What?! Why?!

<b>Witch</b>:  Because you took too long. Now you have to apologize while doing a variety of humiliating things.

<b>Jake</b>:  No way, Jose!

<b>Jake's subconscious</b>:  Come on, dude. It's the only way to save Finn.

<b>Witch</b>:  Who is that?!

<b>Jake</b>:  He's my subconscious.

<b>Witch</b>:  Then he has to do it too.

<b>Jake's subconscious</b>:  Aw...

[<i>Scene transition. Jake is dancing with his subconscious with flowers in his underwear.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  I, Jake the dog, while slow-dancing with my subconscious, with flowers in my underwear, do humbly apologize...

<b>Witch</b>:  [<i>Starts shooting with video camera</i>] Wait, wait. Start over.

<b>Jake</b>:  You're <i>recording</i> this?!

<b>Witch</b>:  It's for my newsletter.

<b>Jake</b>:  No way. I have my dignity.

<b>Witch</b>:  Then guess what, cool guy? You can forget about getting your powers back... EVER!!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To his subconscious</i>] Oh, no, dude! What do we do <i>now</i>?

[<i>His subconscious starts coughing and falls over.</i>]

<b>Jake's subconscious</b>:  I'm dyin', Jake.

<b>Jake</b>:  Wha?!

<b>Witch</b>:  Hm. He says he's dying. Let that be a lesson to all you cupcakes. [<i>Trembles</i>] Hah...

<b>Jake</b>:  Why are you dying, bro?

<b>Jake's subconscious</b>:  Because... I'm the subconscious of your old magical self. [<i>Coughs</i>] Goodbye, Jake...

<b>Jake</b>:  No! No! [<i>Starts crying</i>]

<b>Witch</b>:  So I've finally broken you.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah! [<i>Sobs</i>] If only... I were a humbler guy, my subconscious would be alive, and my best bud wouldn't be trapped in a mermaid's nest!

<b>Witch</b>:  YES! GLOAT, GLOAT, GLOAT! Alright, I think you've learned your lesson. [<i>Kindly</i>] I forgive you.

[<i>Jake regains his fur.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Magically stretching his arms</i>] My powers! How can I ever thank— [<i>Swipes her magic cane away</i>] Ha! Got your cane!

<b>Witch</b>:  WHAAA! OOF! [<i>Falls over</i>] [<i>Jake grabs yet another donut and eats it. His subconscious, now well, gets on his back and they both flee.</i>] But didn't you learn your lesson?!?

<b>Jake</b>:  NOPE!!! [<i>He and his subconscious laugh.</i>]

[<i>Scene transition back to the nest. Finn wakes up.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Hatchlings" title="Hatchlings">Hatchlings</a></b>:  Hungry! Hungry!

[<i>Finn screams.</i>]

<b>Gary</b>:  Remember to save the brain for dessert.

[<i>The Hatchlings move towards Finn. Finn trembles in terror.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Honey, I'm back! How about a big kiss? [<i>Jake kisses her with great force, knocking Gary back into the river.</i>] [<i>To Hatchlings, in a cutesy voice</i>] You guys are so cute! I could just maul you to death!

[<i>The Hatchlings run away.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake! [<i>Hugs Jake's face</i>] I never should have doubted you!

<b>Jake</b>:  Well, I'm glad you learned your lesson: that in a crunch, there's nothin' I wouldn't do for ya.

<b>Finn</b>:  Ahhh, so is that how you got your powers back? You apologized to the witch?

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh... [<i>Sweats profusely</i>] No way! I must have found the right... mud puddle! Yeah... I don't remember. Heh... [<i>Blabbers lips with relief as the episode ends.</i>]
