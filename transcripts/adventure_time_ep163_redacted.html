<b>Jake</b>: [<i>snoring</i>]

[<i>A fly flies into his mouth.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Ah. [<i>smacks lips</i>]

[<i>The fly escapes and buzzes down to <a href="/wiki/BMO" title="BMO">BMO</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neptr" title="Neptr">Neptr</a>, who are playing by the well.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: Stand and deliver, boy, because I'm Robbing Hood. Give me all your funny money, Sheriff of Naughty-hams.

<b>Neptr</b>: But BMO, I don't want to be the bad guy. I want to be Robbing Hood's pal, Friar Tux.

<b>BMO</b>: No, Neptr. [<i>uncaps marker and draws a mustache on Neptr's face</i>] Ha ha! Friar Tux would never have a mustache like that. [<i>laughs</i>]

<b>Neptr</b>: No fair. En guard!

<b>BMO</b>: On Blitzen!

[<i>They hit their sticks together repeatedly. Neptr swings his stick at BMO, but BMO jumps and dodges it.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: You're terrible!

[<i>Neptr swings again, but BMO ducks.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: Whoa!

[<i>The stick hits the wall of the tree fort, which starts rumbling. The wall suddenly cracks, and out bursts a deluge of coins.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: Eeeee!

<b>Neptr</b>: Aaaaa!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>wakes up</i>] What? Hey! What are you kids doing breaking the treehouse?

<b>BMO</b>: Uh...

[<i>Finn and Jake climb down from the boat.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Yo, BMO, what happened?

<b>BMO</b>: You got too much money, honey. All of this dosh is threatening the structural integrity of the treehouse.

<b>Finn</b>: Who would have thought we could have too much treasure?

[<i>Something groans behind them, under the treasure. The <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Psychic_Tandem_War_Elephant" title="Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant">Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant</a> emerges.</i>]

<b>Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant</b>: I'm sorry, master.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!

<b>Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant</b>: You told me to stay inside the money room, but now I am outside. What is your punishment, master?

<b>Finn</b>: No punishment, dude. Just chill where you are.

<b>Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant</b>: All right. I will chill where I am until you command me.

<b>Finn</b>: So what should we do with all this swash?

<b>BMO</b>: You should give it to Robbing Hood.

<b>Jake</b>: No way, BMO. This is our treasure.

<b>BMO</b>: Aw.

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, maybe we could, like, spend it?

<b>Jake</b>: Really? How much of it?

<b>Finn</b>: Dude, like all of it. Then we can find completely new treasure.

<b>Neptr</b>: Neptr knows just the place to blow your grease. Behold, this recent advertisement. [<i>hands flyer to Finn</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Whoa! We get mail?

<b>Finn</b>: Check it out, Jake.

[<i>The flyer reads: Come to <a href="/wiki/Wildberry_Kingdom" title="Wildberry Kingdom">Wildberry Kingdom</a>, a really expensive vacation destination.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Dang! Wildberry Kingdom got all fancy.

[<i>Jake lifts up the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant, gathers together all the treasure, transforms into a legged dump truck, and sets the elephant back down. Finn climbs in, and the two start leaving.</i>]

<b>Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant</b>: I continue to chill.

<b>BMO</b>: [<i>following Finn and Jake</i>] Come on, Naughty-Hams.

[<i>Finn and Jake arrive at the Wildberry Kingdom, passing a gondola, a roadside meat stand, and restaurants. A waiter serves two <a href="/wiki/Wildberry_People" title="Wildberry People">Wildberry People</a> a plate of meat.</i>]

<b>Patron</b>: Thank you.

[<i>The waiter takes the patrons' stacks of money.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Nice place. So how are we gonna spend all this gish?

<b>Jake</b>: I don't know. I've never really spent money before. I've only stolen it or hoarded it.

<b>Finn</b>: Ha!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>sighs</i>] So... here we are in the middle of town.

[<i>Jake dumps the load of treasure in a fountain.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Let's parse out some dough to spend.

[<i>Finn and Jake climb in to the fountain.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Strawberry_Guard" title="Strawberry Guard">Strawberry Guard</a></b>: Hey! What are you doing? No people or money allowed in the fountain, ya dums! Where's your sense at?!

<b>Jake</b>: Sorry, man. We were just looking to spend some cash in town. [<i>offers three coins</i>] Want some?

<b>Strawberry Guard</b>: Fellas, goofing in a public fountain is punishable by a lashing, <i>and</i> you're trying to bribe me.

[<i>Jake offers a crown.</i>]

<b>Strawberry Guard</b>: Ooh! Now that's what I'm talking about, fellas. [<i>takes crown and coins and starts to leave</i>] [<i>laughs</i>] Have a good time in the fountain.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>laugh</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Whoa. Spending money is kind of fun.

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, this'll be easy. [<i>stands up</i>] Ho, ho, young berry lads!

<b>Wildberry kid</b>: Yeah?

<b>Finn</b>: Go buy the most expensive meats and furniture to adorn our new fountain home. Keep the change for your families in need. Hyup! [<i>throws a bag of money to them</i>]

<b>Wildberry kid</b>: Thanks, but we're, uh, middle-class.

<b>Finn</b>: Really?

<b>Wildberry kid</b>: Uh, yeah, upper middle.

<b>Jake</b>: Just get the darn furniture.

<b>Strawberry Guard</b>: Hey, no furniture or meat in the fountain! You'll wreck up the water!

[<i>Jake offers some more treasure.</i>]

<b>Strawberry Guard</b>: You can't buy me off twice, fellas.

[<i>Jake offers still more treasure.</i>]

<b>Strawberry Guard</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Ah, maybe you can, fellas, maybe you can. [<i>runs off</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs maniacally</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Dude, we bought all this furniture and meat, and we still have a ton of gamboni left.

<b>Jake</b>: Hmm. [<i>gasps</i>] Look at those gams! Hey, yo, Legs! Legs! You want a bag of money?

<b>Legs</b>: Sure!

<b>Jake</b>: Well, what are you gonna do for it?

<b>Legs</b>: Well, um, I'm a dancer by trade.

<b>Jake</b>: Show me. [<i>tosses him a moneybag</i>]

[<i>Legs does a sequence of ballet moves.</i>]

<b>Legs</b>: Hup!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Finn, look. I made this guy dance.

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, man. Whoo!

<b>Strawberry Guard</b>: Hold it! No dancing in the streets without a permit!

<b>Jake</b>: Go away, dude.

<b>Strawberry Guard</b>: Hey, you can't talk to me like that.

[<i>Jake tosses him four moneybags.</i>]

<b>Strawberry Guard</b>: All right, I'm going!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs raucously</i>] This is crazy. People do anything for money. And I've got a ton of money. Dance harder, Legs! Harder!

[<i>Jake throws coins at Legs as he dances.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>sighs</i>] This bores me. You're boring! It's time to push this thing further. Middle-class berries, watch after this treasure while I'm gone. [<i>throws them coins</i>]

<b>Wildberry kids</b>: Okay.

[<i>The scene changes to a house in the Wildberry Kingdom, where two Wildberry People are sleeping.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Ahem.

<b>Goji Berry Man</b>: Mabel, do you hear something?

[<i>Mabel turns on the light, revealing Finn and Jake, who is covered in moneybags like a Wildberry Person.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Good evening.

<b>Wildberry People</b>: Oh no! We're being robbed!

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, no, we're not robbers. We're actually here to <i>give</i> you money.

<b>Goji Berry Man</b>: What?

<b>Jake</b>: Listen. I want to see you two do things [<i>places a bag on the bed</i>] for this bag of money.

<b>Goji Berry Man</b>: Okay, man.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Yeah, nice. Goji Berry Man, you sleep on the left side of the bed normally. Now you sleep on the right!

<b>Goji Berry Man</b>: Okay.

[<i>He switches places with Mabel.</i>]

<b>Mabel</b>: I don't like sleeping on your side. It's too close to the wall!

<b>Jake</b>: Mr. Goji Berry, you sleep on your back now—and on top of the covers.

<b>Goji Berry Man</b>: I can't sleep on my back, man. I got sleep apnea. I won't get any sleep. My wife won't get any sleep. My dance instructing will suffer.

<b>Jake</b>: Turning down all this smoosh, huh? Dance instruction pays more than I thought. [<i>starts walking off</i>]

<b>Goji Berry Man</b>: Wait, man! There's got to be something else we can do to get those gold coins.

<b>Jake</b>: Well, sure, man. As a matter of fact, you can have all the gold coins... all the gold coins you can eat!

<b>Wildberry People</b>: [<i>gasp</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Dinner is served! [<i>dumps a moneybag on each of their plates</i>] Yummy, yummy, yummy. Hey, you kids need some desert? I'll just see what I can rustle up—in the toolshed! [<i>laughs loudly</i>] [<i>walks off</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Guys, I'm super sorry about my friend. Here. [<i>gives them two moneybags</i>]

[<i>The Wildberry People start munching the bags.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Don't eat it, ya dums!

[<i>The scene cuts to outside the house, where Jake is coming back from the toolshed with a wheelbarrow of various indigestible items.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: How much do you think I'd have to pay them to lick the dust off all this dusty stuff?

<b>Finn</b>: Dude, I do not approve of the way you're spending money right now.

<b>Jake</b>: Dude, they're not doing anything they don't want to. They want my sweet cheddar, and I want to see some stuff in exchange. It's mutual—free market.

<b>Finn</b>: What?

<b>Jake</b>: Free market! [<i>wheels the barrow to the house</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>to himself</i>] Don't worry, brother. I'll help you see the error of your ways.

[<i>Back in the Wildberry Kingdom, the Wildberry kids are standing on the pile of loot. Finn runs up to them.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Berry lads! Berry lads! I need to spend all this blingo fast.

<b>Wildberry kid</b>: Okay.

<b>Finn</b>: Take me to the seediest alley in the kingdom.

<b>Wildberry kid</b>: That's Crudberry Back Alley... in Crud Town.

[<i>In Crudberry Back Alley, some homeless Wildberry People are sleeping on the ground. Finn and the Wildberry kids arrive with a wheelbarrow of treasure.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Friendly Crudberries, I have money for you! Come get it!

<b>Hobos</b>: Money? Money!

<b>Finn</b>: Easy, fellas! Let's pass these out one at a time.

[<i>A hobo tries to take one of Finn's bags.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, take it easy, breh.

<b>Hobo</b>: Give us that money! [<i>punches Finn</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: I-I-I don't want any trouble. [<i>punches a hobo</i>] I'm trying to help you.

[<i>They continue fighting each other in the alley. Finn then runs out with his face covered in juice.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>sits</i>] Whew! [<i>pants</i>]

[<i>One of the hobos peaks around the corner, but Finn punches him with his eyes closed.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: How much coin would it take for you to be my berry foot warmer?

<b>Finn</b>: Dude!

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, hey, man.

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, this money is bad. We got to get rid of all of it right now.

<b>Jake</b>: Okay, I got a plan. And this time, it's gonna involve <i>all</i> the money.

[<i>The song "<a href="/wiki/Money" title="Money">Money</a>" plays as Finn and Jake bribe their way past several guards and the elevator operator to <a href="/wiki/Wildberry_Princess" title="Wildberry Princess">Wildberry Princess</a>, who is sleeping in a tub of meat in a "decompressing" room.</i>]

[<i>Jake throws moneybags at the door.</i>]

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: [<i>yawns</i>]

[<i>Jake continues throwing the bags and breaks down the door.</i>]

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: Finn and Jake?

<b>Jake</b>: Princess, are you ready to earn all this cay-ash?

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: What...?

<b>Jake</b>: All of this sweet, sweet crunkle is yours if you let me... [<i>holds up a tiny stool</i>] sit on your head.

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: [<i>yelling</i>] Get out of here!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>scoffs</i>] No one can say no to this much dinero. ♪M-m-money♪

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: Jake, I am warning you.

[<i>Jake shrinks down and sits on Wildberry Princess' head.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: ♪M-m-money♪

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: [<i>growls</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: ♪M-m-money♪

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: Aah! Guards! Guards! Seize Finn and Jake and prepare them for execution!

<b>Jake</b>: Or don't do that and get paid mad bucks.

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: And take all their money!

<b>Jake</b>: Take all my money?!

[<i>The scene cuts to Finn and Jake hanging by their wrists on a stage.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Well, we were trying to get rid of all that skrilla anyway, right?

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: Finn and Jake, yes, you have insulted me, but worse than that, you have abused the power of money!

<b>Crowd</b>: [<i>gasps</i>]

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: We will deal with you swiftly and ironically by encasing you in your own molten gold!

[<i>Above Finn and Jake, a Wildberry Person stirs a gigantic pot of liquid gold.</i>]

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: Release the golden flood!

[<i>A Wildberry Person turns a crank, which releases the flow of gold.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>gasps</i>]

[<i>Just before the gold pours on to Finn and Jake, an arrow hits the chute and pushes it over the Strawberry Guard.</i>]

<b>Strawberry Guard</b>: Oh, no! Aah!

[<i>Gold encases the Strawberry Guard. The crowd disperses, screaming.</i>]

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: Who dares?

<b>BMO</b>: Ho, ho, ho! Robbing Hood is the defender of the poor!

[<i>A Jelly Horse gallops up, with Neptr tied to its side.</i>]

<b>Neptr</b>: Me too!

<b>Jake</b>: Good shot, BMO!

<b>BMO</b>: I was aiming for the rope. [<i>shoots an arrow</i>] Yeah!

[<i>The arrow hits Jake in the armpit. Jake pulls it out and cuts Finn and Jake's ropes with it.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Let's bounce, po' boy.

[<i>They all get on the Jelly Horse and ride away.</i>]

<b>Wildberry Princess</b>: Finn and Jake, if you ever return to Wildberry Kingdom again, I'll have you double-dipped in gold! Unless I get a written apology.

[<i>Outside the Tree Fort, Finn spots a coin.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Huh? Gold piece. You want to flip to see who writes that apology letter?

<b>Jake</b>: How about you write it, I sign it.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] No way, man.

[<i>Finn and Jake enter the now-empty treasure room. Finn flips the coin, which rolls across the floor and down a hole.</i>]
