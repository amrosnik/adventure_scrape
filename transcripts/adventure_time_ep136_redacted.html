<b>BMO</b>:  Ha-ha! I win!

[<i>BMO and Finn take their blindfolds off as <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a> walks in carrying groceries.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, hey, man.

<b>Jake</b>:  You and BMO play Finger Spread quietly. I need to get into the <i>zone</i>. [<i>walks over to the window and looks up</i>] I am ready to receive instruction from the realm of creation above me and <a href="/wiki/Jake%27s_most_delicious_sandwich" title="Jake's most delicious sandwich">the sandwich</a> I am about to conceive. I am open; use me.

[<i>Jake turns on some classical music and starts dancing. He takes a deep breath. The scene cuts to him washing vegetables and then sharpening knives.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>sharpening knives</i>] One, two, three, four, five, six. [<i>putting herbs on a steak</i>] Rosemary, thyme. [<i>puts the steak in a bag, seals it, and places it in a pot of hot water</i>] Sous-vide. Keep that at 135 degrees. [<i>cuts a loaf of bread in half and uses a blowtorch to toast the inside</i>] All right, now we're gettin' somewhere. [<i>places each ingredient on the bread as he says their names</i>] Cream cheese! Pickles from my boy <a href="/wiki/Prismo" title="Prismo">Prismo</a>! And some dill! [<i>grabs a bird from the windowsill</i>] Diced boiled eggs! Bird from the window! Yeah, baby, now we're rollin'! Whoo!

[<i>Finn and BMO climb up the ladder to the kitchen.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Common cucumber! Sliced Roma tomato. Sweet yellow onion—organic. [<i>tears up</i>] Oh, almost done. [<i>wipes tears away and puts them in the sandwich</i>] Tears for salt. Meat prepared sous-vide. ♪Bacon.♪ [<i>holds up a lobster</i>] You're the most important part. [<i>He puts the lobster in a pot of boiling water, and its soul escapes. Jake shoos it onto the sandwich.</i>] Lobster soul. [<i>puts on the top piece of bread, completing the sandwich and causing it to glow blue</i>] It's amazing! Ohhh, [<i>falls backwards, and Jake and BMO catch him</i>] this is the greatest sandwich I've ever made!

<b>Finn</b>: Is it glowing?

[<i>The three get up and walk to the sandwich.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: You guys want some?

<b>Finn</b>: It's cool, man. I know you want to eat the whole thing, and I'm cool with that.

<b>Jake</b>: Thank you. [<i>Jake picks up his sandwich, and is about to eat it when a shower of sparks comes from the other side of the room, and <a href="/wiki/Magic_Man" title="Magic Man" class="mw-redirect">Magic Man</a> appears. Jake then gasps.</i>] Magic Man!

<b>Magic Man</b>: Magic dog! I'll take some sandwich!

<b>Jake</b>: You stay away from my woman! Eh, my sandwich!

<b>Magic Man</b>: [<i>scratching his chin</i>] Hmm... yeah, I could do that... or... wait, wait! [<i>he conjures a portal that allows him to grab Jake's sandwich</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Sandwiche! Mijo! Magic Man! My sandwich!

<b>Magic Man</b>: That's a good-looking sandwich.

<b>Jake</b>: What are you gonna do with it? Something gross?

<b>Magic Man</b>: [<i>breathes on the sandwich</i>] It's got my germs, so it's mine now.

<b>Jake</b>: NOOOO! [<i>stretches his arms toward Magic Man</i>]

<b>Magic Man</b>: Dead arms! [<i>casts a spell</i>]

[<i>Jake's arms become limp and fall to the floor.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>groaning</i>] Give it back, you animal!

<b>Magic Man</b>: Look, if you really want your sandwich, you'll have to solve my little riddle. [<i>punches the "Timeless" clock and moves the hands</i>] When your face shows 7:20, when green leaves turn brown, the only way forward is down. Then you'll see, the wetter, the better.

<b>Jake</b>: That's not even a riddle! It's wordplay, at best!

<b>Magic Man</b>: You try and come up with something on the spot! It's hard! [<i>makes a portal and slaps Jake through it</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Ow!

<b>Magic Man</b>: Now to savor the moment. [<i>crashes through the wall</i>] [<i>in mid-fall</i>] It's just you and me, baby. [<i>moves sandwich toward his open mouth and snaps his fingers, creating a slow-mo sphere</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: What the?

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, wait!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>growls</i>] What's he doin' in there? Why did he freeze himself with my sandwich?

<b>Finn</b>: He's not frozen. He's super slow-mozin', motion. Look.

[<i>Camera zooms in on Magic Man's mouth, where some saliva drips in slow-mo.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Aww, that's gross!

<b>Finn</b>: Well, let's go grab it before he hits the ground, which is when I assume he'll take a bite.

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, okay.

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm. [<i>pats sphere and puts his arm in it</i>] Feels like cold spaghetti. [<i>puts his head in</i>]

[<i>Jake follows suit.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>slow-mo</i>] Oh... hey, Jake.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>slow-mo</i>] Hey, Finn.

[<i>Outside, the clouds move by quickly, showing that time is only slowed inside the sphere.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>slow-mo</i>] How long have we been in here?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>slow-mo</i>] I don't know.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>slow-mo</i>] Retreat!

[<i>The two slowly pull themselves out and gasp for air. <a href="/wiki/BMO" title="BMO">BMO</a> has joined them.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa, how long were we in there?

<b>BMO</b>: Five hours.

<b>Jake</b>: Five hours?! [<i>stretches around the sphere to see Magic Man</i>] He's halfway to hittin' the ground... which is when he'll bite my sandwich, probably.

<b>BMO</b>: Yes.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>groans</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>scoldingly</i>] BMO!

<b>BMO</b>: I agree that is when he will probably take a bite.

<b>Finn</b>: You're not helping.

<b>BMO</b>: Oh, you need help? I can help. [<i>screen turns to a green spiral</i>] Processing.

<b>Jake</b>: Must be his new software.

<b>BMO</b>: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [<i>face returns to normal</i>] Ding! I have the solution, Jake.

<b>Jake</b>: What?! BMO, are you serious?

<b>BMO</b>: Yes, this plan will work.

<b>Jake</b>: Yes!

<b>BMO</b>: But we have to hurry.

<b>Jake</b>: Yes!

<b>Finn</b>: Alright, BMO!

[<i>They run inside, come out with some wood, and start building a ramp. Jake hammers a nail, pausing to look at his sandwich, which is now closer to Magic Man's mouth. Jake resumes hammering at a quicker pace. Finn sets up a camera, as BMO gets to the top of the ramp with <a href="/wiki/BMO%27s_skateboard" title="BMO's skateboard">its skateboard</a>.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Wait, wait, wait. BMO, are you just making a skateboard video?

<b>BMO</b>: No, Finn. This is the plan.

<b>Jake</b>: Are you sure?

<b>BMO</b>: Jake, you will have your sandwich back before my board hits the ground.

<b>Jake</b>: Okay, BMO.

<b>BMO</b>: Yay, BMO! [<i>skateboards down the ramp and gets airborne</i>] This is iiiii... [<i>lands in the sphere and starts slowly falling</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: He lied to me.

<b>Finn</b>: Relax. [<i>takes a phone out of <a href="/wiki/Finn%27s_pack" title="Finn's pack">his pack</a></i>] I'm calling <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a>. It's ringing.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Maybe I should just make another one. [<i>goes inside, turns on the radio again, and dances limply</i>] [<i>sighs deeply</i>] Eh, okay. Let's do this. I can make another awesome sandwich. Creation realm, inspire me once again! [<i>looks out the window at storm clouds, and the wind chimes fall</i>] [<i>uncertainly</i>] Okay.

[<i>Outside, Princess Bubblegum is using a device to inspect the time bubble.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Thanks again for coming, Prubbles.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Of course, Finn. Once you explained about Jake's sandwich, I had to. [<i>pulls device out of sphere</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: So, how's it looking?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I'm picking up major levels here.

<b>Finn</b>: Of magic?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Molasses.

<b>Finn</b>: Oh.

[<i>They start walking over to some <a href="/wiki/Banana_Guard" title="Banana Guard" class="mw-redirect">Banana Guards</a> holding missiles.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: He's using a molasses-based super-covalent subatomic bond, slowing down anything that enters its field, but only if the molasses is at room temperature. Hmm, this one. [<i>takes a missile from a Banana Guard</i>] My molasses warmer will get things moving.

[<i>She moves a level on the missile, causing a smaller missile to shoot out of the bigger missile. She presses some buttons on her watch, and the smaller missile drops an angry bear-shaped bomb, which goes inside the sphere and explodes behind BMO.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: [<i>slow-mo</i>] ...iiiiiiiii...

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Well, I'm out of ideas. [<i>activates a <a href="/wiki/Holo_technology" title="Holo technology">holo-phone</a></i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Who ya calling?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: <a href="/wiki/Marceline" title="Marceline">Marceline</a>.

<b>Finn</b>: The vampire queen?!

[<i>Inside, Jake has two pieces of bread and a wilted leaf of lettuce.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Oh... maybe... maybe it's just as good! [<i>puts the sandwich together and takes a bite</i>] Blech! [<i>spits it out and throws the sandwich on the floor</i>] It's terrible! [<i>starting to cry</i>] Dang you, Magic Man! You took my one and only! [<i>takes a bag and heads outside</i>]

[<i>Marceline has now joined them.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: See, I think the molasses must be protected by some sort of chemical—

<b>Marceline</b>: Oh, hey, Jake. How you holding up?

<b>Jake</b>: Not too well. BMO looks cool, though.

<b>BMO</b>: [<i>slow-mo</i>] ...iiiiiiii...

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>sighs</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Don't be sad.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Yeah, Marceline's got a great plan.

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, man!

<b>Jake</b>: What's your plan?

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>transforms into a winged beast</i>] Demon juice! [<i>jumps up</i>] [<i>growls</i>] [<i>lands in the sphere behind BMO</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: ...iiiiiiiii...

[<i>Jake takes some candles out of the bag and lights them.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, man. What are you doing?

<b>Jake</b>: I'm lighting these candles so I can move on with the grieving process. I made them with the leftover bacon fat from my sand—[<i>sobs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: I am not giving up. [<i>takes out phone</i>] Let's see. Who should I call? <a href="/wiki/Ice_King" title="Ice King">Ice King</a>? <a href="/wiki/Shelby" title="Shelby">Shelby</a>? <a href="/wiki/Tree_Trunks_(character)" title="Tree Trunks (character)">Tree Trunks</a>?

It's over, and I've never been so sad. And you know what? I got to deal with it. [<i>walks into sphere but does not slow down</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, look!

<b>Jake</b>: Hmm? What? But how?

<b>Finn</b>: Because you've never been this sad! That's what Magic Man meant by your face showing 7:20, or as some people call it, a sad face.

<b>Jake</b>: What?! Nobody [<i>begins to slow down</i>] calls it that.

<b>Finn</b>: Nope! No! Don't get judgmental.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Stay sad.

<b>Jake</b>: Right. [<i>walks deeper into the sphere</i>] [<i>sobbing</i>] Magic Man, I'm gonna sock you in the head! [<i>punches his palm</i>] [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>starts slowing down again</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, every time you get happy, you slow down! Stay sad, man! Make yourself sad!

<b>Jake</b>: Uh... okay!

[<i>He imagines his funeral, with <a href="/wiki/Lady_Rainicorn" title="Lady Rainicorn">Lady Rainicorn</a> crying over his grave.</i>]

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>: I, I love you, Jake. We should have hung out more.
