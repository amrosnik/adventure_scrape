[<i><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a> are walking through a forest at night.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: And when that salsa cloud had you by the tail...?

<b>Jake</b>: Ha ha, yeah. And I swung him around into that golden cactus?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Man, that was algebraic.

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, man, that adventure was tight.

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah.

<b>Jake</b>: I can't wait to get back home, though.

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, me, too!

<b>Jake</b>: I need some sleep—

<b>Finn</b>: I'm gonna play some <i>Battle Wars</i> with <a href="/wiki/Neptr" title="Neptr">Neptr</a> on <a href="/wiki/BMO" title="BMO">BMO</a> for an hour, then work on that flier for <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">PB</a>'s laser recital and catch up on my correspondence with my pen pal Danny Gladiolas from over in Maryville.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>nods</i>] Great minds. [<i>points to head</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: And then next what I'm gonna do is I'm— whoop! [<i>disappears down a hole</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Finn? [<i>runs</i>] Finn! [<i>hits head on branch</i>] Ohh! [<i>groans, stumbles backwards, and falls into another hole</i>] Oh...

[<i>Finn wakes up to the sound of marching. He opens his eyes to see a line of food people carrying empty trays.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What the...?

[<i>Several food people are seen carrying food, preparing food, and tending to a wind-up clock.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Man, where's this supposed to be?

[<i>A <a href="/wiki/Huge_King" title="Huge King" class="mw-redirect">Huge King</a> is being fed by the tiny food people.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Uh, excuse me? Sir?

<b>Huge King</b>: Hmm? Oh! You're awake! Oh, that's wonderful!

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, thanks. Hey, where am I, anyway?

<b>Huge King</b>: Why, this is the famed Kingdom of Huge, of course. Heh. You fell through that crack in my ceiling and landed in a normal-sized pie.

<b>Finn</b>: Mm-hmm. Well, my friend up top is probs pretty worried about me, so I'd best get going. Can you give me a boost back up to that crack or whatever?

<b>Huge King</b>: Oh-ho-ho! No, no, no. Don't be silly, child. Your friend must be on his way to find you right now. You should wait for him here, or you could miss each other.

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm. I guess that does make sense.

<b>Huge King</b>: Of course! Besides, you're just in time to witness the chiming of my wondrous clock! It's set to do its chiming in merely an hour's time!

[<i>The clock bears the inscription "In toil we krimber."</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>to himself</i>] "Krimber"?

<b>Huge King</b>: Come! Food boys! Shower our guest with the kindnesses of Huge! We will await the clock's chiming in style and comfort.

[<i>A food boy presents a cake to Finn.</i>]

<b>Huge King</b>: Dig in, child! There's always more to come!

<b>Finn</b>: Mmm. Oh! Apple scruffs!

<b>Huge King</b>: Just wait till you see my clock!

[<i>Jake wakes up to a bear with a candle on his head and bells strung around him whistling and playing cards (Freecell) with himself on a platform suspended by what appear to be parachutes. Close-up on a glass jar of water with a metal ladle in it, followed by the bear's card game with a green book titled "Dividing The Day" next to it.</i>]

<b>Bear</b>: Ahh, good, you're awake. [<i>gets up and walks toward Jake</i>] Good good good good good. How you feelin'?

<b>Jake</b>: Ohh... [<i>rubs head</i>] my cabbage aches a little... What happened?

<b>Bear</b>: [<i>Sits down</i>] Well, here I was, playin' some Freecell, and then, wow! You fell down the hole. Bounced off parachute #2, an' landed on three ol' walnuts.

<b>Jake</b>: Parachute? Hole? Walnuts? Fell down, wait! [<i>gets up</i>] You mean we're fallin' right now? [<i>stretches up and to the left</i>] Thanks for your help, buddy, but I gotta go.

<b>Bear</b>: [<i>Grabs onto Jake as his feet leave the platform</i>] Woah, hold up! [<i>Jake's reached the wall with Bear holding on</i>] What's your hurry?

<b>Jake</b>: My friend's still up top. He could be lookin' for me. Or, he could be in trouble and every second I'm down here I'm fallin' further away. I gotta get back.

<b>Bear</b>: Uhhh, I think that's a pretty bad idea. You were unconscious while you were fallin', remember? So you mighta been fallin' for weeks, or even, months. [<i>Platform falls further away</i>] Trust me, it's possible. This is a very deep hole. If you try to climb out, you could run out of food.

<b>Jake</b>: But, I gotta do somethin'!

<b>Bear</b>: I feel like you should prob'ly not starve to death, so that when your friend comes lookin', you're still alive.

<b>Jake</b>: Mmm. You know I think you're right! [<i>stretches down to the platform</i>] Finn is a pretty heroic kid, I gotta admit. He'll pro'ly be here in half a gif.

<b>Bear</b>: Oh, good. Well 'til then, please, make yourself at home. Here, [<i>lifts candle hat and takes out walnut from underneath</i>] have a walnut.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Takes walnut</i>] Thanks, man. I'm Jake, by the way.

<b>Seven</b>: Hi, Jake. I'm seven-seven-one-eight. Strange name, I know, but I'm pretty sure. See, I carved it in the floor when I first got down here so I wouldn't forget. [<i>"7718" inscription is just "BILL" upside-down.</i>] But you can call me Seven for short.
