<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>:  Hey, <i>fart</i>-face!!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Huh?

<b>Finn</b>:  Unhand Princess Bubblegum!!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Foolish interlopers! Zah! [<i>Fires ice magic at Finn</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Evading it</i>] Whoa! [<i>Throws a snowball at him</i>] Ah!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Ee hee hee hee—OOH! [<i>Gets hit by snowball</i>] MY EYESIGHT!

[<i><a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a> forms his posterior into Princess Bubblegum's shape while Finn puts two rocks on it, representing her eyes. He replaces Princess Bubblegum with his posterior without Ice King noticing.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Huh? Hee hee hee!

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, Ice King! I bet you'll never kiss the princess!

<b>Ice King</b>:  I will kiss her! I will! [<i>To "princess"</i>] Hold still. [<i>Kisses Jake's posterior</i>] Mwah!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] You just kissed Jake's butt!

<b>Ice King</b>:  What?! [<i>Jake reforms his posterior.</i>] EEEEGH!! [<i>The other three laugh.</i>] [<i>Flying away</i>] The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine! Just like you, Princess—MINE!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  What a patoot. Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys.

<b>Finn</b>:  You're welcome, Princess. [<i>She hugs him.</i>] Uh... [<i>He blushes, and Jake raises his eyebrow, amused.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  I'm gonna throw you two a party. Meet at the Candy Kingdom—TONIGHT!

[<i>The three cheer. "PARTY TIME" logo pops up and balloons fill up the screen to shift to the next scene. Finn and Jake are walking to the <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum%27s_castle" title="Princess Bubblegum's castle">Candy Castle</a> through the <a href="/wiki/Cotton_Candy_Forest" title="Cotton Candy Forest">Cotton Candy Forest</a>.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum?

<b>Finn</b>:  I just thought I'd bring 'er a gift... in return for throwing us this party.

<b>Jake</b>:  Heh. I bet you wish you were my butt.

<b>Finn</b>:  What?

<b>Jake</b>:  I bet you wish <i>you</i> were my butt, because then the princess would... No, wait... I bet you wish <i>you</i> were the Ice King and the <i>princess</i> was my butt!

<b>Finn</b>:  What?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmm... [<i>Snapping</i>] OH! I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the Ice King and my butt! Hahahaha!

<b>Finn</b>:  That's ridiculous! [<i>Finn imagines Princess Bubblegum kissing him, and he sighs contentedly.</i>] Huh? Uggghhh!! [<i>Jake runs ahead laughing.</i>] What's so funny?

[<i>Hard cut to the Candy Castle</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Peppermint_Butler" title="Peppermint Butler">Peppermint Butler</a></b>:  Hey, everybody. Finn and Jake are here.

<b>Jake</b>:  Who's ready to party?!

[<i>The crowd seems focused on and gathered around something else. Finn and Jake confusedly look at each other.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What's everyone laughing at?

<b><a href="/wiki/Wildberry_Princess" title="Wildberry Princess">Wildberry Princess</a></b>:  Shh!

<b><a href="/wiki/Ricardio" title="Ricardio">Ricardio</a></b>:  Stand back, everyone. This style of massage is called, "<a href="/wiki/Best_Friend_Massage" title="Best Friend Massage">Best Friend Massage</a>."

<b><a href="/wiki/Lumpy_Space_Princess" title="Lumpy Space Princess">Lumpy Space Princess</a></b>:  Oh, my gosh...

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Because it can only be done for friends. It is completely consensual.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh, holy cow...

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Relax yourself now, Lumpy Space Princess... YAH! [<i>Backflips and pounds her</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh! I feel so great!

<b>Finn</b>:  Who <i>is</i> that guy?

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Hahaaa!

[<i>Jake shrugs. A fanfare is heard and Princess Bubblegum enters.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Greetings, party-goers! Glad you could all make it!

<b>Finn</b>:  Princess Bubblegum! [<i>Ricardio stares at her and he himself starts "beating" hard.</i>] Princess. I just wanted to thank you for—

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Cutting in</i>] Oh, my gosh! PB, ya gotta check out this super cute guy. You're gonna love 'im. [<i>They leave Finn and Jake.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhhh...

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  This is... Oh. Oh, my gosh. I don't even know your name.

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Ricardio. Ricardio at your service. I've been waiting all evening to meet you, Princess. [<i>Kissing her hand</i>] Mwah! [<i>Finn pockets his gift, irritated.</i>] I've heard you appreciate ancient technology. Have you ever used the balbaflonic laser to align the hybernotalist rift in the bubaflon plasmodial formation?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Whoa! No, I haven't! [<i>Music starts up; crowd moves to the dance floor.</i>] Wanna continue this conversation on the dance floor?

<b>Ricardio</b>:  [<i>Exiting with her</i>] It would be my pleasure, Princess.

<b>Finn</b>:  Why didn't the princess invite <i>me</i> to dance?

<b>Jake</b>:  If you wanna dance, just go <i>dance</i>!

<b>Finn</b>:  But now she's dancing with <i>him</i>! Ah... I feel... <b>weird</b>!

<b>Jake</b>:  Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand... like jealousy.

<b>Finn</b>:  BLAAAARGH!!

<b>Jake</b>:  Look, man, just go out there and get down! [<i>Pushes him onto the dance floor</i>]

<b>Ricardio</b>:  [<i>To Princess Bubblegum</i>] —transmordial layers completely independent of the babylons. Eh?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Wow! That would mean that the babylons would fluctuate with the piranha-nanosphere!

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Correct!

<b>Finn</b>:  Agh! [<i>Goes back to Jake</i>] They're talkin' about science, man! I can't compete with that!

<b>Jake</b>:  Do the <a href="/wiki/Science_Dance" title="Science Dance">Science Dance</a>! Remember it? It was sorta like this. [<i>Does it</i>] Wah unh we ah eeh...

<b>Finn</b>:  You think that'll work?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah! Probably. [<i>Pushes him back onto the dance floor</i>] Do it, man! You're a pro!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Dancing</i>] Science Dance! Science Dance!

<b>Ricardio</b>:  [<i>Still talking with Bubblegum</i>] —lower proximities to—

<b>Finn</b>:  Science Dance! Hey, eh, Princess! You wanna spend some time with <i>me</i>?

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Excuse me, Princess. You must excuse me. [<i>Exits</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Oh, uh... Alright! [<i>To Finn</i>] Finn, what the <i>cabbage</i>? I was learning about <a href="/wiki/Zanoits" title="Zanoits">Zanoits</a>!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Prevaricating</i>] Oh... I'm... into Zanoits! Th-They're the best!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of <a href="/wiki/Plantoids" title="Plantoids">Plantoids</a> a year.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, no, not the Plantoids!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Plantoids produce mellotoxin! [<i>Finn stares.</i>] Mellotoxin <i>kills</i> Zanoits!!

<b>Finn</b>:  ...So are Zanoits... <i>good</i> things?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Changing the subject</i>] You're totally jealous of Ricardio.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, I'm not. I just don't like the way he talks to you. It makes me feel weird.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  That's jealousy, hun.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm not <i>jealous</i>! I'M <i><b>WEIRD</b></i>!!!

[<i>The party notices Finn's scene.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To himself</i>] Woof! Man... This is goin' <i>bad</i>. Hey, Finn. You gotta come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar. It can't wait. [<i>He and Finn are alone.</i>] Wow, man, what <i>happened</i> out there?

<b>Finn</b>:  Agh... I don't know! I was tryin' to warn 'er, but she twisted my words around and—

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too.

<b>Finn</b>:  I <i>know</i>! And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. I think he's... a villain.

<b>Jake</b>:  Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic?

<b>Finn</b>:  No! I can just feel it in my gut! He's up to something sinister!

<b>Jake</b>:  Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'll <i>prove</i> he's a villain!

<b>Jake</b>:  How?

<b>Finn</b>:  Stakeout.

[<i>Scene shifts to outside in the Candy Kingdom. Finn and Jake are on a roof, and Finn is looking through binoculars.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Here he comes! [<i>Viewing Ricardio and Princess Bubblegum</i>] They're talking!

<b>Jake</b>:  Lemme see. [<i>Gets binoculars</i>] I can read their lips. [<i>Mimicking Princess Bubblegum</i>] "Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart!" [<i>Mimicking Ricardio</i>] "You look kind of like a big pink baguette!"

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Taking back binoculars</i>] Get serious, Jake!! This is life and death!

<b>Jake</b>:  <i>Is</i> it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just <i>looks</i> wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice.

<b>Finn</b>:  I gotta trust my gut!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Grabbing gut</i>] Hmm.

<b>Finn</b>:  He's on the move! Let's roll! [<i>The two swing onto a <a href="/wiki/Gumball_Guardian" title="Gumball Guardian">Guardian of the Royal Promise</a>.</i>] I see 'im. He's holding rope and going into the trash. He's smashing bottles—and pretending to stab someone!

<b>Jake</b>:  So... he's recycling... or what?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Takes off binoculars</i>] I think your gut's a little naive, Jake. [<i>Puts on binoculars</i>] Holy moly! He's... he's with the Ice King! They're shouting something! [<i>Ice King and Ricardio quarrel.</i>] Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away!

<b>Jake</b>:  So I was right! He <i>is</i> a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious! [<i>To gut</i>] You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes!

<b>Finn</b>:  No way. This proves he's a <i>super</i>-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!

[<i>Jake sings the <a href="/wiki/Gut_Song" title="Gut Song">Gut Song</a>.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Then it's settled! We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil!

<b>Jake</b>:  Or good!

[<i>Scene cuts to downtown in the Candy Kingdom. Ricardio walks deviously and accidentally runs into Finn.</i>]

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Oof!

<b>Finn</b>:  So what're you doin', Ricardio? Are you evil?

<b>Jake</b>:  Or nice with an evil face?

<b>Ricardio</b>:  That's none of your business.

<b>Finn</b>:  The safety of Princess Bubblegum <i>is</i> my business!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not.

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Oh, yeah?

<b>Finn &amp; Jake [<i>In unison</i>]</b>:  Yeah.

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Oh, <i>yeah</i>?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah. [<i>Slightly annoyed</i>] Yes!

<b>Finn</b>:  You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff!

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Now that my plan is nearly complete, there is no way you could stop me.

<b>Finn</b>:  I could stop you if I wanted!

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Oh, yeah?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah!

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Oh, <i>yeah</i>??

<b>Finn</b>:  YEEEAAAH!!!

[<i>Finn punches Ricardio, knocking him down. Princess Bubblegum enters.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] What's going on here?

<b>Finn</b>:  Princess?!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Ricardio?!

<b>Ricardio</b>:  [<i>Weakly</i>] Yes... I'm alright, Princess.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn... why'd you do it?

<b>Finn</b>:  He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  These were for our balbaflonic laser.

<b>Ricardio</b>:  It's not all his fault, Princess. I might've looked a little threatening.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn... you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are! You gotta stop this jealous business.

<b>Finn</b>:  But...

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  C'mon, Ricardio. I'll patch you up and give you candy. [<i>They exit.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Sigh</i>] She <i>hates</i> me now. I was totally wrong about Ricardio.

<b>Ice King</b>:  No, Finn! [<i>Emerges from dark alleyway</i>] You were not wrong. He is evil! [<i>Collapses</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ice King! What do you know about this? Tell me or I'll do something!

<b>Jake</b>:  Hold up, Finn! The Ice King looks sorta damaged!

<b>Finn</b>:  I don't care! I only care about Ricardio!

<b>Ice King</b>:  But my enervated condition has <i>everything</i> to do with <i>him</i>. [<i>Flashback begins; Ice King does voice-over</i>] I was trying to cast a spell that would give me total control of Princess Bubblegum's heart! ...But I messed it all up... and lost control of <i>mine</i>. [<i>Ricardio come's out of Ice King's chest in flashback. He runs towards the window laughing.</i>] He planned to rip out Princess Bubblegum's heart... to make it his bride. [<i>Ricardio sticks his tongue out and exits laughing.</i>] Without my heart, I grew weak. [<i>Ice King groans in flashback.</i>] But I made my way to the Candy Kingdom to look for him. In an alleyway, I begged him to [<i>In flashback, Ice King mouths these words as current Ice King says them</i>] return to me and leave the princess alone. [<i>Flashback ends.</i>] But he threw me in the dumpster and left me for dead. [<i>Reaching his hand out at Finn</i>] Stop Ricardio!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Slapping hand away</i>] Agh! Come on, Jake! [<i>They run to the Candy Castle.</i>] Gotta save the princess!

[<i>They enter.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Princess Bubblegum!!

<b>Finn</b>:  Princess!! [<i>Gasps</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn!! Jake!!

[<i>She is tied up in the rope from earlier and Ricardio is next to her with the broken bottle in his hand.</i>]

<b>Ricardio</b>:  You were right all along, Finn! Now I'm going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it!

<b>Finn</b>:  Not if I can help it!

[<i>They chase Ricardio, and Ricardio ends up next to Bubblegum again.</i>]

<b>Ricardio</b>:  One step closer and I'll remove her heart!!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn! I feel like a big idiot for doubting you! He was just so engaging! ...But his knowledge on plantoids is actually pretty weak.

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Shut your mouth up, Princess! [<i>Jake knocks Ricardio down by stretching his jowl at him.</i>] I'm gonna smooch that heart!! It will be my bride!!

<b>Finn</b>:  Why don't you marry someone your <i>own</i> size?! Like my foot?!

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Huh?!

[<i>Finn kicks him.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  And my fist?!

[<i>Finn punches him twice.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Crawling in</i>] Stop! Stop it! That's my <i>heart</i>, you piece of—

<b>Finn</b>:  Ice King. [<i>Ice King crawls towards Ricardio.</i>] Should we... let 'im take his heart back? He <i>is</i>... <i>villainous</i>...

<b>Jake</b>:  I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, yeah...

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Wait! Wait! No!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Come to daddy...

<b>Ricardio</b>:  Noooooooooo!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yeah, there you go... [<i>Puts him in his chest</i>] Like that? Huh?

<b>Ricardio</b>:  [<i>Sinking into chest</i>] Seeee you guys laterrrr...

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Reinvigorated</i>] I feel wonderful! Hahaha! And now that I've saved the Princess, she'll marry me and live in my dungeon every day!

<b>Finn</b>:  No, she won't!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  <i>Yeah</i>, no, I won't!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yes you WILL! [<i>He charges up his ice magic, but Finn kicks him. He begins flying away.</i>] Well... maybe not today... or tomorrow... but another day! Another—[<i>Accidentally knocks head on door frame. He grunts in pain as he exits.</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts to a dining room in the castle. Finn, Jake, and Bubblegum are eating spaghetti.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Thanks again for saving me... <i>again</i>.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Mouth full</i>] Don't mention it.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Now that Ricardio's gone, you don't have to be jealous of anyone anymore. [<i>Winks</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I <i>never</i> get jealous.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Romantically</i>] Kiss me, Finn. [<i>Finn blushes, astonished.</i>] Ahem. [<i>She is doing a hand-stand and wearing a Jake mask on her posterior. She uses a deeper voice.</i>] I mean... kiss me, Finn. [<i>Normal voice, whispering</i>] Am I doing it right, Jake?

[<i>Jake chuckles.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  NOOOOOOOO!!!

[<i>Iris out</i>]
