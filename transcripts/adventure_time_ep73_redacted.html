<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>grunting</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  It's slippin', dude.

[<i>They groan as they set it down on a table.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Phew. [<i>reading title</i>] Raini-corni-copia? An Unabridged History of the Rainicorns. [<i>yawns</i>] Whatever, man. I barely even made it through the title.

<b>Jake</b>:  Listen, man. One day, I'm probably gonna have <a href="/wiki/Jake_and_Lady%27s_offspring_(disambiguation)" title="Jake and Lady's offspring (disambiguation)">half-rainbow pupsters</a>. I gotta be able to share my babies' culture.

[<i>They open the book.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>mumbling indistinctly as he reads</i>]

[<i>Finn rocks the table.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh. [<i>goes under the table</i>] Oh. [<i>comes out from underneath it</i>] Hey, this table is wobbly. We gotta take it to the <a href="/wiki/Lost_Tinker_Goblin_of_Fog_Mountain" title="Lost Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain">Lost Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain</a> to fix it.

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude, I would love to go on some crazy, made-up adventure with you, but I <i>really</i> gotta read this. So from here on out, I'm just gonna ignore you. [<i>continues reading and mumbling</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I don't make up adventures! Jake, you know that! Jake! I don't make up adventures! [<i>lifts and drops the end of the table a few times</i>] Hm. [<i>leaves Jake and walks past some shelves</i>] Books, books. [<i>reading titles</i>] Kitties, Zitties, Witties, Mitties, Knitties, Fitties, Hitties, Jitties, Pities, Cities... [<i>comes to some books with damaged spines</i>] Oh, no! Damaged books? Who did this?!

<b><a href="/wiki/Turtle_Princess" title="Turtle Princess">Turtle Princess</a></b>:  Shhhhhhhushh!

<b>Finn</b>:  Sorry. [<i>to books</i>] I will avenge thee, slightly-soiled books. Gotta tell Jake.

[<i>He starts walking back when he sees some books shake.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hello? [<i>looks behind books</i>] Is someone back here? Are you stuck?

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  Shhhushmm!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>quietly</i>] Hello? [<i>pages start coming out of the books</i>] Whoa! Ohhh! Hey, there's pages comin' outta these books!

<b>People offscreen</b>:  SHHHHHH!

[<i>The pages fold themselves into <a href="/wiki/Pagelings" title="Pagelings">Pagelings</a>.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Who are you dudes?

<b>Pagelings</b>:  We are the Pagelings!

<b><a href="/wiki/Paper_Pete_(character)" title="Paper Pete (character)">Paper Pete</a></b>:  I am Paper Pete, the leader of the Pagelings. But <i>you</i> can call me P.P.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'll call you Pete.

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Okay!

<b>Finn</b>:  Why are you dudes in the library?

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  We are the secret guardians of the books in the library. You know those blank pieces of paper in the beginning of old books?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah?

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  That's us! We revealed ourselves to you, noble giant, because you felt our plight when you saw the damaged books. And now is our darkest hour, for the <a href="/wiki/Moldos" title="Moldos">Moldos</a> have been growing more bold with every attack. Look at the damage done yesterday [<i>pulls out a damaged book</i>] at the Battle of <a href="/wiki/Teddy_Bear_Joke_Book" title="Teddy Bear Joke Book">Teddy Bear Joke Book</a>.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wow, yeah.

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  They're massing for a full-scale assault on every book in the library!

<b>Finn</b>:  Gosh! Even the Rainicornicopia?

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Yes.

<b>Finn</b>:  I better tell Jake. Don't you dudes go anywhere.

<b>Pagelings</b>:  Okay.

[<i>Finn runs back to Jake.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, bro, I've got an adventure—and it's not made up! There are these- these Pagelings they came out from- from books! And they- they folded into little animals.

[<i>Jake <a href="/wiki/Stretchy_Powers" title="Stretchy Powers">stretches</a> his foot onto Finn's mouth.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Do you hear what I'm saying?!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>shakes head</i>] Shhhh!

<b>Finn</b>:  You think I'm making this up?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>nods</i>] [<i>motions for Finn to go away</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I'll prove it to you! [<i>drags the Rainicornicopia off the table onto the floor and starts dragging it away</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn! [<i>following Finn</i>] Finn, you butt chicken!

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, wait till you see 'em.

[<i>Jake tackles Finn and they bump against the bookshelf with the Pagelings, who retreat into the shelf as books fall off the shelf on top of Finn and Jake.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ow.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>grunts and strains as he lifts the Rainicornicopia and drags it back</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  They were just here! Pagelings?

[<i>The Pagelings reappear.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Why didn't you dudes introduce yourselves to Jake?

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  We don't want to reveal ourselves to anyone else. We are the <i>secret</i> guardians. <i>Secret</i>.

<b>Finn</b>:  Ummmm... yeah, but Jake is a powerful giant like me! He can help you battle or- or whatevs! But first, you must win his favor. Do you not want victory for your people?

<b>Pagelings</b>:  Yes! We do want victory!

<b>Finn</b>:  C'mon, follow me. [<i>he leads them to Jake</i>] Jake, look.

[<i>Jake buries his face in the book.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>to Pagelings</i>] He's up here reading a book.

[<i>The Pagelings climb onto the table.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Do something to get his attention.

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Very well. We shall dance as flowers.

<b>Other Pagelings</b>:  Hoo-ah!

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay.

[<i>The Pagelings turn into flowers and start dancing around Jake, who is hiding his face behind his hands.</i>]

<b>Pagelings</b>:  [<i>grunt and sing indistinctly as they dance</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, the Pagelings are dancing for you. Just look up for a second!

[<i>Jake stretches his face out from underneath his hands as the Pagelings dance outside his field of vision.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn, all the little voices you're doing are cute, but come on, man! Just let me read. [<i>buries his face again</i>]

[<i>The Pagelings jump onto Jake's head and transform back to normal.</i>]

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  By wearing the beast, [<i>they rip off some fur</i>] we shall become like the beast. [<i>they place the fur on their heads</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  You can feel them, can't you?

<b>Jake</b>:  I can feel <i>you</i> pinching me.

<b>Finn</b>:  Just look up for a second! [<i>trying to lift up Jake</i>] Looooook. [<i>gives up</i>] Uhhh. Pagelings, I'm sorry, but my friend is acting like a clump.

<b>Pagelings</b>:  Okay.

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  We can't wait any longer. We must go back to the bookshelf to prepare for the Moldos' attack

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, go play make-believe somewhere else!

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm not making believe!

[<i>Scene cuts to Paper Pete.</i>]

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  [<i>gasps</i>] We were gone too long!

[<i>Some Moldos are shown eating books and Finn is standing nearby.</i>]

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Wield, my brethren. Wield!

[<i>They charge at the Moldos.</i>]

<b>Pagelings</b>:  [<i>battle cries</i>]

[<i>They start fighting the Moldos weakly and calmly.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>yawns and exhales, blowing the Moldos and Pagelings off their feet</i>]

<b>Moldo</b>:  You win <i>this</i> battle, but next time, <i>we</i> will win.

[<i>The Moldos retreat.</i>]

<b>Pagelings</b>:  Yes, leave! Victory! Veni, vidi, vici!

<b>Finn</b>:  So, those little squishy guys are the Moldos?

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Aye. This was but a reconnaissance squad... sent to test our mettle!

<b>Pagelings</b>:  Mettle!

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh-huh. They seem tough.

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Their bites sting like the Dickens.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmmm... their bites sting, eh? I've got a plan, Pete.

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Tell me your plan, giant.

<b>Finn</b>:  Just trust me. [<i>picks up Paper Pete</i>] Trust me.

[<i>Some Moldos are seen slithering past some shelves. Finn, with Paper Pete on his shoulder, peeks around the corner and sees them enter a bookshelf on the far wall. He runs toward the shelf and removes some books.</i>]

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  You've discovered the <a href="/wiki/Moldos%27_Secret_Lair" title="Moldos' Secret Lair">Moldos' Secret Lair</a>!

<b>Finn</b>:  Eh, it wasn't very hard.

[<i>Finn crawls through to the Moldos' lair. There are crystals growing on the walls, but no Moldos in sight.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Wibba-wibba-wah!

[<i>Scream echoes and several Moldos appear.</i>]

<b>Moldo</b>:  The Pagelings have a battle beast! Attack!

<b>Moldos</b>:  [<i>battle cries</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa. Whoa, moldy blobs. I've come here to help the Moldos defeat the Pagelings.

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Traitor! [<i>brandishing paper sword</i>] Hiyah! Yah!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>quietly</i>] Calm down, this is part of my plan.

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Ohhh, ha-ha! Then I shall play along, wise giant. [<i>winks</i>]

<b>Moldo</b>:  How are we to trust you?

<b>Finn</b>:  Well... here, look. [<i>takes Paper Pete off his shoulder</i>] I brought you all a prisoner. It's their leader.

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  May you rot in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tartarus">Tartarus</a>! May your skin boil and eyes burst into flames... forever in a pit! [<i>winks</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>winks</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts to Paper Pete being lifted up in a cage made of pencils and rulers.</i>]

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Traitor!

<b>Finn</b>:  So, do you guys have, like, a—like, a leader or somethin'?

<b>Moldos</b>:  [<i>murmuring and whispering</i>] <a href="/wiki/Mildwin" title="Mildwin">Mildwin</a>.

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Mildwin.

<b>Mildwin</b>:  I'm Mildwin, leader of the Moldos.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, uhh... hmm. [<i>gets down on the floor</i>] Nice to meet you, your highness.

<b>Mildwin</b>:  I'm not a king; I was democratically elected.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>laughs</i>] That's adorable. [<i>beat</i>] Now, Finn! [<i>grabs Mildwin and several Moldos, kicks apart Paper Pete's cage, and runs out of the lair</i>]

<b>Moldo</b>:  Protect the elected official!

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Well played, ol' giant. [<i>winks</i>] You have the cunning of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Odysseus">Odysseus</a>. [<i>winks several times</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Pete, j-just stop winking. [<i>jumps on top of a table and onto bookshelf</i>] Hyah!

<b>People</b>:  Shhhh!

[<i>Finn jumps down from the bookshelf near Jake.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ignore <i>this</i>! [<i>throws the Moldos at Jake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmm?

[<i>The Moldos start eating Jake's fur.</i>]

<b>Mildwin</b>:  Mmm! This tastes delicious! [<i>chomps on a bit of Jake's flesh</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  AAAAH! AAH!

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

<b>Jake</b>:  What did you do to me?! AAAAAAH!

<b>Finn</b>:  Ummm...

<b>Jake</b>:  AH! AAAH!

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhhh... come on, you guys, knock it off.

<b>Moldo</b>:  [<i>hisses at Finn</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  The Moldos got a taste for ya now.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>screams in pain</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Gotta do something. Where can I find ways to solve problems in a library? [<i>sees a poster</i>] "Books"? [<i>gets a book and starts hitting Jake with it</i>] Books! Books! Books!

<b>Jake</b>:  Aaah!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>sees a Moldo eating his shirt</i>] Huh? Whatcha nibblin' <i>me</i> for?

<b>Moldo</b>:  This sweaty stuff tastes amazing. <i>A-mazing</i>!

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmmm. Tastier than battle beast fur. Yis! [<i>takes off his shirt</i>]

[<i>He notices that Turtle Princess saw this. Turtle Princess blushes and runs back to her cart of books.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, Mildwin. Mildwin!

<b>Mildwin</b>:  What?

<b>Finn</b>:  I bring a peace offering from the Pagelings.

<b>Mildwin</b>:  Hmm?

[<i>The Moldos sniff the shirt, crawl onto it, and start eating, except for two, which are latched onto Jake's closed eyelids.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn... what's happening?

<b>Finn</b>:  Hang on, buddy. Paper Pete?

[<i>Paper Pete flies in in the form of a paper plane, lands on Finn's shoulder, and transforms back to normal.</i>]

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  Giant! Have you wiped out the Moldo horde?

<b>Finn</b>:  Naw, man. The war's over. [<i>pokes Mildwin</i>] Mildwin, you can keep my shirt if [<i>points to Paper Pete</i>] you don't attack their library books.

<b>Mildwin</b>:  Agreed, beast. This filthy garb will feed my people for generations.

<b>Finn</b>:  And in forty years, you can have my shorts. Sound good, Pete?

<b>Paper Pete</b>:  It will suffice.

<b>Finn</b>:  Sound good, Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>pulls the remaining two Moldos off his eyes</i>] AAAH! What—What the hecks, man?! What'd you do to me?!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>holds up his shirt</i>] Look, man! Moldos and Pagelings are real!

<b>Jake</b>:  Wha—? Who cares, man?! I'm outta here!

[<i>Scene cuts to Finn and Jake walking away from the library.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Did you finish your Rainicorn book?

<b>Jake</b>:  Ugh... I was readin' the same paragraph over and over for, like, eleven minutes. I guess I'm gonna give up on learnin' everything about Rainicorn history. Don't tell <a href="/wiki/Lady_Rainicorn" title="Lady Rainicorn">Lady</a>.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh. What about relating to your mixed-species kids?

<b>Jake</b>:  Eh, I'll just fake it.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh. Well... hey, man, I think I see some, um... [<i>points to the sun</i>] Sun People in trouble on the sun over there.

<b>Jake</b>:  You makin' that up?

<b>Finn</b>:  Mmhmm.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah! Let's do it! [<i>starts running toward the setting sun</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>follows Jake</i>] WHOO! WHOOOO!
