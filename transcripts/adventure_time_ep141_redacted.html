<b>Jake</b>: [<i>moans</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What's wrong with you, man?

<b>Jake</b>: I ate all the candy in <a href="/wiki/Finn%27s_pack" title="Finn's pack">your backpack</a>, and now I'm sick.

<b>Finn</b>: I didn't bring any candy.

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, no. That explains why it didn't taste right.

<b>Finn</b>: Nothing tastes right today. Like, I thought we were going to get into some serious flavor with these sand people, but they're just standing around like garnish.

<b>Jake</b>: That's how I feel—like a dying parsley. So what's goin' on with <a href="/wiki/Spoon_of_Prosperity" title="Spoon of Prosperity">the spoon</a>? <a href="/wiki/Marceline" title="Marceline">Marceline</a> and the spoon.

<b>Finn</b>: Um... [<i>looks at the spoon on top of the column</i>] nothing. [<i>The spoon is lifted up and comes down.</i>] Wait, there she goes!

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>invisible</i>] Yo, wake up, sand dude. [<i>taps a sand soldier with the spoon, causing the sculpture to crumble.</i>] I think they're dead. [<i>brings spoon over to Finn and becomes visible</i>] A spoon.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>takes spoon</i>] Yea-uh. The Spoon of Prosperity!

<b>Jake</b>: It doesn't look like mu—[<i>belches</i>]

[<i>The belch echoes and causes more sculptures to crumble.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, my gosh, I feel so much better! Hungry, even. Guys, let's go home!

<b>Finn</b>: We've gotta get this spoon to <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a> first.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>running off</i>] ♪Let's rock!♪

<b>Marceline</b>: What's PB want with that spoon, anyway?

<b>Finn</b>: Beats me.

<b>Jake</b>: Sometimes it's better <i>not</i> to know.

<b>Marceline</b>: Yeah, I guess that's true with Bonnibel.

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, guys, look what I found! [<i>starts sinking in the sand</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Is that quicksand?

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah! [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>tries to get out several times but keeps falling back</i>] Heh. Quicksand is pretty fun. Heh.

<b>Finn</b>: Quit messing around, Jake.

<b>Jake</b>: Okie-doke.

[<i>Jake <a href="/wiki/Stretchy_Powers" title="Stretchy Powers">stretches</a> an arm from his head to the support underneath the platform Finn and Marceline are on. The support crumbles, and Finn falls.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa!

[<i>More structures behind them crumble.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hmm. Hey, is this whole place made out of sand?

<b>Marceline</b>: Sure looks that way.

<b>Jake</b>: Uh, give me a pull, please. [<i>stretches his upper body to Finn and Marceline, who grab him and pull</i>] [<i>laughs</i>] Stop, you guys are tickling me! Let me try this other thing. [<i>shapeshifts his body into a corkscrew</i>] Flesh drill!

<b>Finn</b>: I'm not sure that's a good idea—

[<i>Jake starts drilling, rumbling the entire city.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>screams</i>] Yaah! Rug burn! Ow! Ow!

[<i>The large pillar of sand collapses.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Aah! [<i>escapes the quicksand</i>] Whoo! It worked! Jake drill worked, you guys.

[<i>Marceline grabs them and floats upwards to avoid the avalanche of sand coming their way.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa!

<b>Jake</b>: Check it out! My piggies are free. [<i>wiggles toes</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: You just demolished half the underground city!

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, only half.

<b>Finn</b>: You also sealed our exit.

<b>Jake</b>: Our <i>only</i> exit.

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>groans</i>] [<i>drops Jake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: No regre-e-e-ets! [<i>tumbles down a hill</i>] I'm sorry. [<i>touches his toe</i>] This little piggie stayed home, and so should have I. I know! I'll dig us out of here.

<b>Finn &amp; Marceline</b>: No!

<b>Finn</b>: You'll bury us alive!

<b>Marceline</b>: Undead!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>takes out his <a href="/wiki/Holo_technology" title="Holo technology">holo-pendant</a></i>] Finn to PB. Come in, PB.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh, hi, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>: Princess, we're trapped in the underground city.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Yeah-yeah. That sounds great.

<b>Finn</b>: Huh? No, we need help!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: That's great! [<i>display glitches</i>] Gre-gre-great! Great, great!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Guess we lost the signal. [<i>puts away pendant</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Any more bright ideas?

<b>Jake</b>: Snacks!

<b>Marceline</b>: How are snacks gonna get us out of here?

<b>Jake</b>: I wanna eat snacks... because I am hungry.

<b>Marceline</b>: I'm hungry, too. Bust the snacks, Finn.

<b>Jake</b>: Bust, bust, bust!

[<i>Finn takes off his pack and dumps its contents on the ground. Jake takes a cookie out of the pile.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Hey, where are my red erasers? They were in here.

<b>Jake</b>: Uh-oh. I thought they were candy.

<b>Marceline</b>: You... ate all... MY RED?!?!

<b>Jake</b>: Oooh. I'm sorry!

<b>Finn</b>: Calm down, Marceline. There's gotta be some red stuff in these ruins. I'll go explore. You guys hang out here and save your energy.

<b>Marceline</b>: Thanks, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>walking off</i>] Be cool.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>eats cookie</i>] So how hungry <i>are</i> you?

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>hisses</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Aah! [<i>cowers</i>] I'm sorry. Please don't eat my blood!

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Jake, I don't want to hurt you, but you should know things get crazy when I'm hungry.

<b>Jake</b>: Like... how crazy?

<b>Marceline</b>: I'm gonna go into feral mode. [<i>sighs</i>] It's not gonna be pretty.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>whimpers</i>] [<i>eats the rest of his cookie</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: I know. Let's tie me up. That way, you won't be scared.

<b>Jake</b>: And that will keep you from draining my bloods?

<b>Marceline</b>: Not physically, no, but as a prop, I think it'll be good for both of us. You know, psychologically.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>gulps</i>] [<i>whispers</i>] Hurry, Finn.

[<i>Scene cuts to Finn passing some streams of lava.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Red, red, red. I guess even a <a href="/wiki/Vampires" title="Vampires">vampire</a> queen's face would melt off if she tried to eat lava.

[<i>Scene switches to Marceline, who is tied up to a sand column.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Get me a bucket of lava, Jake.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>eating a sandwich</i>] Yo, you know better than that.

<b>Marceline</b>: Do iiiit...

<b>Jake</b>: Don't go crazy, okay?

<b>Marceline</b>: I'm frickin' hungry.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>gulps</i>] Why did you leave me here, dude? [<i>bites sandwich</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts back to Finn. He arrives at a large door of sand held up by four skeletons, behind which some red light is emanating.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Okay, here we go. Yeah, look at that! [<i>points to red glow</i>] Something crazy red behind this door. Hmm. [<i>looks at skeletons</i>] Why are y'all holding this door shut? You don't look like sand peeps, neither. More like wisemen-zerts . Oh, well. Gotta feed the Marcy monster. [<i>walks up to door</i>] 'Scuse me. Up, sorry. Okay. Uhh... hi-yah! [<i>kicks the door, which collapses</i>] Oh, dag.

[<i>Finn looks into a room full of immobile sand people bathing in the red light coming from a crown on a skeleton at the other side of the room.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Cool... What the heck happened here? [<i>grabs a hat from one of the skeletons</i>] Whoop! [<i>throws hat in the red light, which turns it to sand</i>] Ew. Whoops. Y'alls got turned <i>into</i> sand people. Don't go in the light. Go like this. [<i>walks along the edge of the room</i>] Around it. Next time, you guys. Hmm... [<i>sees that the source of the light is coming from a hole behind the skeleton</i>] Whatever's down there's gotta have red blasting out of every hole. Hey, you're not still alive, right?

[<i>The skeleton does not respond.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Okay. I was just making sure. [<i>crawls into hole</i>] Bet that guy was a creep. [<i>continues crawling</i>] This hole is deep.

[<i>Scene cuts back to Jake.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, my <a href="/wiki/Grob_Gob_Glob_Grod" title="Grob Gob Glob Grod">Glob</a>. Oh, my Glob, where are you, man? Marcy's wiggin' out!

<b>Marceline</b>: Jaaaake...

<b>Jake</b>: What?

<b>Marceline</b>: I can smell your insides, Jake. [<i>laughs</i>] They smell... [<i>sniffs deeply</i>] red!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>screams</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Yeah, lemme see in there.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>screams</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Oh, yeah.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>screams</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts back to Finn.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Maybe I should go back. Well, I've already gone this far. [<i>reaches the end of the tunnel, where a red gem is shining light</i>] Shebang! That oughtta be enough red to un... [<i>notices that the red light is coming from a large turtle creature behind the gem</i>] Oops.

<b><a href="/wiki/Crab_Demon" title="Crab Demon">Crab Demon</a></b>: Paris? Is that you?

<b>Finn</b>: You mean the guy with the big thing on his head?

<b>Crab Demon</b>: Yes. Have you returned to complete the plan?

<b>Finn</b>: Naw. Paris is, like, super dead.

<b>Crab Demon</b>: What?! No! How long?

<b>Finn</b>: Dude, like, a really long time. Like five hundred years.

<b>Crab Demon</b>: [<i>in disbelief</i>] Five hundred—[<i>sighs</i>] Chum! I must've zoned out!

<b>Finn</b>: What the heck were you two doing?

<b>Crab Demon</b>: Once we turned the city to sand, we were gonna reanimate their bodies and conquer my homeland at the center of the planet.

<b>Finn</b>: Hm, that's dumb.

<b>Crab Demon</b>: Time to go back home a true loser.

<b>Finn</b>: Can I have this big ol' ruby, then?

<b>Crab Demon</b>: That's an emerald.

<b>Finn</b>: Clearly it's a big ol' ruby.

<b>Crab Demon</b>: I don't know what to tell you, man.

<b>Finn</b>: I would like the ruby.

<b>Crab Demon</b>: It's yours, buddy. [<i>gets up</i>] I'm outties. [<i>backs out</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Peace. Hyup! [<i>jumps down and tries to pull the ruby out</i>] [<i>strains</i>] [<i>farts</i>] Whoops.

[<i>Scene cuts to Marceline, who is buried up to her demonic face in sand.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Okay, [<i>pats sand</i>] all done now. Nice and snug, right?

<b>Marceline</b>: Jake...

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>gulps</i>] What?

<b>Marceline</b>: I won't be able to... to control myself much longer. I can feel the feeding frenzy coming on. [<i>licks teeth</i>] I just wanna let you know I'm sorry. [<i>laughs evilly</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: You're sick!

<b>Marceline</b>: Yeah... [<i>laughs</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: C'mon, Jake, think... [<i>groans</i>] It's no good! I need brain food. [<i>looks at pile of Finn's junk</i>] Oh, dang, I ate everything! [<i>moans</i>] I'm so hungry! Baby's gonna starve to death! Unless... [<i>looks at Marceline</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: What?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] [<i>licks lips</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts back to Finn, who is pushing the ruby back through the tunnel.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>straining</i>] [<i>stops and cries a little</i>] [<i>resumes pushing</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>panting</i>] [<i>digs a lava moat around Marceline</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: What are you doing?

<b>Jake</b>: I'm cooking up a crazy vampire! That should heat up nice! The sand will keep the meat moist.

<b>Marceline</b>: You're gonna eat me?

<b>Jake</b>: You was gonna eat me!

<b>Marceline</b>: Yes, I am. [<i>laughs</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>blows lava</i>] Cook, baby, cook!

[<i>Finn arrives with the ruby.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Finn!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>falls to the ground, exhausted</i>] Bleh. The trick is rollin' it. Phew! Check out this ruby I got.

<b>Jake</b>: That's an emerald, dude.

<b>Finn</b>: You too now?! Emeralds are green, boyee.

<b>Jake</b>: This thing <i>is</i> green.

<b>Finn</b>: Why is everybody messin' with me? It's like a dark gray-ish red. Mostly gray. Sometimes red things are gray!

<b>Jake</b>: You're a little colorblind... and there's nothin' to be ashamed of!

[<i>The "ruby" is now green.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Oh... whoops.

<b>Jake</b>: I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far.

<b>Finn</b>: Uh, what's goin' on with Marcy?

<b>Jake</b>: She was threatening to eat my insides, so I'm cooking her. I know that sounds crazy, but I had no choice.

[<i>Marceline is now missing.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now. What? [<i>looks behind him to see that Marceline is gone</i>] [<i>gasps</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Chill, man!

<b>Jake</b>: No, we gotta book! [<i>pushes Finn into tunnel</i>] Go!

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>floating near the ceiling</i>] Go where, Jake? [<i>laughs</i>] I gotta suck out your insides first, right?

<b>Finn</b>: Nay-nay, brah!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>babbles</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Time to eat! [<i>The ceiling rumbles.</i>] Huh? What the—?

[<i>A <a href="/wiki/Sand_Worm" title="Sand Worm">large worm</a> breaks through the ceiling. Princess Bubblegum is in its mouth, controlling it.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Bubblegum?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Hey, guys. I saw my seismograph had gone off the charts, so I figured you might be in trouble, right?

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, but watch out for Marceline. She's gone rabid!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: What? Marceline's gonna rap for me?

[<i>Marceline grabs Princess Bubblegum and bites her hair.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>screams</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>gasp</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Woof. Thanks, Bonnie. That's enough low-grade red to get me home, at least. Come on, guys. Let's go.

<b>Finn</b>: Are you alright, PB?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>weakly</i>] Did you get the Spoon of Prosperity?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>takes it out of his pack</i>] Yeah, here you go. [<i>hands it to her</i>]

[<i>Princess Bubblegum places it on her nose, and she returns to normal.</i>]

<b>Finn, Jake, &amp; Marceline</b>: Whoa.

[<i>Finn, Jake, and Marceline applaud.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Peeps will never starve in <i>my</i> eternal empire. Sand worm, up!

[<i>The sand worm leaps upward as the city fills with lava.</i>]
