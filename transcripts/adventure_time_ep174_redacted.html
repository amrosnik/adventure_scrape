<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>singing Prismo's Ritual</i>] ♪Fallen ally, fallen ally, home now in the sky. Fallen ally, fallen ally, a single tear we cry.♪

<b>Finn</b>: ♪A truer friend, there was none.♪

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: ♪ And Prismo was his name.♪

<b>Jake</b>: ♪An artisan of pickling, and now just one remains.♪

<b>Jake</b>: ♪And now just one♪— [<i>crying noises</i>] I can't do this, man! I-it just can't be over!

<b>Finn</b>: Hey... We can put it back in the fridge, if you want.

<b>Jake</b>: No, these picks were made by our friend to be mouth-loved!

[<i>Jake walks over to the pickle jar while making kissing noises, then suddenly stops</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: We have to honor his memory with a final taste of his genius. [<i>picks up pickle jar</i>] Get ready for the dream ritual.

[<i>Finn bangs gong, they start humming and then burst into dance</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>screaming</i>] Prismo we love you forever in our dreams!

[<i>Finn and Jake start chanting</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>screaming, getting progressively louder</i>] Pickle rama, pickle rama, pickle rama, PICKLE RAMA!

<b>Jake</b>: Finale!

[<i>Jake stretches into a large ball shape and juggles food items with several hands while they hum. Jake stretches his tongue down to the pickle in the jar, and eats it. A blast of light explodes from the jar.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Whoof! What was that?

<b>Jake</b>: Quick, to bed! This has to be the last thing we think about!

[<i>Jake grabs the jar, and they run off to bed</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hyup! [<i>jumps into bed</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Okay... dream! [<i>closes eyes</i>]

[<i>Screen fades to black, cut to Tree Fort at day time</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>mumbles</i>] Aughhh! [<i>Finn sees thorn in hand, sits up panting</i>] Whoo! Crazy dream, man. Prismo was definitely in it, but—Jake?

[<i>Scene cuts to Jake's bed, with only the pickle jar in it</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: You up already?

[<i>Finn walks to window, sees Jake re-enacting the burial of the <a href="/wiki/Everything_burrito" title="Everything burrito" class="mw-redirect">Everything burrito</a></i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What the...

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>grunting</i>] Whup! Oof. [<i>crying</i>] I love you, Everything Burrito.

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, why are you pretending to dig up Everything Burrito?

<b>Jake</b>: Huh, what?

<b>Finn</b>: Hold on, I'm coming down.

[<i>Jake explodes into dust, Finn comes running out of the Tree Fort</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, you gotta hear my dream, I—Jake?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>re-enacting teaching the <a href="/wiki/Dancing_Bug" title="Dancing Bug" class="mw-redirect">Dancing Bug</a> to dance</i>] Hey, man, you're shaking it all wrong!

<b>Finn</b>: What the jump?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>points at ground</i>] Shh. Let me show you how.. it's... done!

[<i>Music starts playing, and Jake dances</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, are you sleepwalking?

<b>Jake</b>: No, I'm showing this— Whoaaaa! [<i>Jake explodes into dust again</i>]

[<i>Finn screams</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Wake! [<i>slaps himself</i>] Up! [<i>slaps himself again</i>] Tunk... I'm not dreaming!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>appears in Tree Fort doorway</i>] You made an oath. Okay.

[<i>Finn screams, turns to look at Jake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>running towards Jake</i>] Jake! I saw you explode. Something messed up is haps, bruh.

<b>Jake</b>: Pshhh. Please, not even. [<i>folds arms</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: No, man, you blew into chunks over there! [<i>Finn points backwards, Jake looks surprised</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Uh, because <a href="/wiki/Kee-Oth" title="Kee-Oth">Kee-Oth</a> was right there! A-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. Uuuuuhhh... [<i>faints</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, this already happened. C'mon, man, stop freakin' me out [<i>kicks Jake, who then explodes into dust again</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>coughing</i>] Ugh, Jake dust!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>distantly</i>] ♪ <a href="/wiki/Bacon_Pancakes" title="Bacon Pancakes">Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes</a> ♪

[<i>Scene cuts to kitchen where Jake is re-enacting making pancakes</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>while Finn climbs up behind him</i>] ♪ Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes ♪

<b>Jake</b>: ♪ Take some bacon and I'll put it in a pancake ♪

<b>Jake</b>: ♪ Bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make ♪

<b>Jake</b>: ♪ Bacon pancaaake! ♪

<b>Finn</b>: Dude, what is the deal?

[<i>Scene cuts to various sections of the <a href="/wiki/Time_Room" title="Time Room">Time Room</a></i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>zooming in on him</i>] Dude, what is the deal?

<b>Prismo</b>: [<i>appearing from the right</i>] Huh hmm huh hmm huh hmm. I can't wait to get this batch of pickles to Jake. He's totes gonna bust a pipe when he gets hit with the cumin and the undertones of sage that come in later. [<i>disappears</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>exasperated</i>] Prismo, I'm right here! Where you going, bro!? [runs off]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>calling out</i>] Wait up, man, how're you alive!? [<i>Prismo pulls a brick back in the wall and appears for a brief second after Jake passes by</i>] Finn and I saw your old man host body get destroyed by the— [<i>gasps</i>]

[<i>Jake's path ends at the <a href="/wiki/Wake_Up" title="Wake Up">scene where the Lich kills Old Man Prismo</a></i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>shocked</i>] The Lich?!

<b>The Lich</b>: Wake up.

[<i>The Lich shakes old man Prismo awake</i>]

<b>Prismo</b>: Wa—Wait, I've changed my mind—[<i>gasp</i>]

[<i>Prismo is off from the walls—his dream self dies.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>watching from above</i>] Wait, why is this happening? It's like a rerun of the worst junk.

[<i>The Lich kills old man Prismo and is subsequently crystallized by a Citadel Guardian and is taken away with Finn and Past Jake holding on</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>while watching the above</i>] Lich life-sucks Prismo's dream host, eliminates Prismo forever. Ugh, it's mad gris bro. And then the Space Police, or whatever they're called, show up because boppin' Prismo is a cosmic crime. I remember feelin' like someone had peeled a layer away from my brain, and my reality was no longer anchored to any point of reference, and I had to fight to keep from being crushed under the weight of an unforgiving new paradigm of ultimate reality. So cool, man. So why am I seeing this again?

[<i>Jake makes his way from the ledge to the edge of the space hole</i>]

[<i>The Time Room disassembles, several blocks at a time and then a path appears in front of Jake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Uhhh, that's cool...

[<i>Scene jumps back to a bored Finn at the Tree Fort</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Uhh, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough guy contest! [<i>flexes bicep</i>] Whoo-hoo! [<i>Does a spin and poses</i>] Tough boys!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>groans</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Come on, man! Tough Guy contest me!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>while Jake continues his re-enactment behind him</i>] Okay, seems like all of Jake's remanifesting themselves, [<i>turns to viewer</i>] but as soon as I break their history it creates a paradox and Jake explodes.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>turning to Finn</i>] Whoa, Finn, how'd you get over there? [<i>explodes into dust</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Finn, when I die my individual Earth consciousness is going to go all over everywhere while <a href="/wiki/Grob_Gob_Glob_Grod" title="Grob Gob Glob Grod">Glob</a> tallies my deeds.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>confused</i>] What?

<b>Jake</b>: I'm going to all around you [<i>starts turning into a tree</i>], in your nose, in your dreams and your socks...

<b>Finn</b>: "in your dreams?"

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, that's what I said, in your dre— [<i>explodes into dust</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: All this striz happened when Jake and I tried to preserve Prismo's pickles in our dreams, something must have changed when we went to sleep!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>zooms out to the still messy room</i>] So, ugh, I just got to hope that Jake tries to do the pickle ritual again. So I can re-enact it with him. Exactly the way it happened, maybe?! Geez!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>re-enacting Prismo's ritual</i>]♪ Fallen ally, fallen ally, you're home now in the sky.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: ♪ Fallen ally, fallen ally, a single tear we cry.♪

[<i>Scene jumps back to the Time Room</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: I guess I'm headed towards that door..

<b>Prismo</b>: <a href="/wiki/Jake_the_Dog_(episode)" title="Jake the Dog (episode)">Dude, I get out of relationships</a> because I don't want to have a discussion about what we're gonna to have for dinner <i>every night</i>! [<i>more distantly</i>] 'Cause when I'm alone...

<b>Jake</b>: Hehe, all these dudes and their lady problems...

<b>Prismo</b>: That's right, Prismo is nothing but the dream of a wrinkly old man.

<b>Jake</b>: What if the whole world was just some goof's dream? Man, that would be stupid. Whoa!

[<i>Camera pans out to reveal that Jake has entered a large room with a floating bed in an alcove on the far side</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Rrrm, wait a minute... What is this!? This couldn't be a...oh Grod! [<i>looks under the bed</i>] Permanent, opposing, industrial-strength, magnetic bed! [<i>looks at the side</i>] Hand-hewed from a single tree [<i>looks at the bedspread</i>] Oh, man! Look at this mattress! [<i>gasps</i>] What is it? [<i>sniffs</i>] Smells like a blend of cashmere... [<i>sniffs again</i>] Mohair, silk and wool maybe... [<i>touches the blanket</i>] The thread count on this is in the thousands! And it's filled with... [<i>sniffs</i>] Down feathers of a baby griffin! That's illegal! [<i>Turns to nightstand</i>] Glass of milk... This feels like a trap designed by some kind of sick genius!

<b>Jake</b>: Well... [<i>gulps milk and gets in the bed</i>] hats off to you sir or madam, your trap was a success!

<b>Jake</b>: Oh my blahs! [<i>tears up</i>] It's like I'm getting Eskimo kisses from an army of angels! [<i>Starts crying and suddenly falls asleep, snoring</i>]

<b>Prismo</b>: [<i>Suddenly appearing</i>] Oh, dang, I'm back!

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>still re-enacting Prismo's ritual</i>]♪ Prismo we love you forever in our dreams! ♪

[<i>Finn and Jake start chanting</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>screaming, getting progressively louder</i>] Pickle rama, pickle rama, pickle rama, PICKLE RAMA!

<b>Jake</b>: Finale!

[<i>Jake stretches into a large ball shape and mimes juggling food items with several hands while they hum. Jake stretches his tongue down to the table (there is no jar), and mimes eating a pickle.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Whoof! What was that?

<b>Jake</b>: Quick, to bed! This has to be the last thing we think about!

[<i>Jake mimes grabbing the jar, and they run off to bed. Jake picks up the pickle jar in his bed</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hyup! [<i>jumps into bed</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Okay... dream! [<i>closes eyes</i>]

[<i>A ding is heard and a bright light from the pickle jar shines out and Jake disappears</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>stunned</i>] Whoa! The pickle jar! I'm coming Jake! [<i>jumps into the jar and gets warped away</i>]

[<i>Finn materializes in the Time Room</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>looking around</i>]Whoa...Where the heck am I?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>calling out</i>] Wait up, man, how're you alive!?

<b>Finn</b>: Jake!? I'm coming man![<i>runs off</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Finn and I saw your old man host body get destroyed by the—

<b>Finn</b>: Jake! Don't explode!

<b>Prismo</b>: [<i>reaching his arm out in front of Finn, making him stop</i>]Finn, hold up.

<b>Finn</b>: Prismo! I saw you die, dude!

<b>Prismo</b>: Yep, I'm still dead. I'm actually talking to you from the past, I set up this plan B scenario in case I ever got croaked for reals. So if this is happening then I guess I got croaked and my pickles ran out. But Jake and I established a bro-bond that could bring me back through his dreams.

<b>Finn</b>: So, are you actually talking to me right now or are you pretending to in an empty room?

<b>Prismo</b>: I was pretending, but now I can see you.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>makes air quotes</i>]What does 'now' meant to you?

<b>Prismo</b>: Uhhh...hurry up I need your help [<i>opens wall and Finn walks through</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Running past</i>] Where you going bro? Wait up man, how're you alive?

<b>Finn</b>: So where're we going?

<b>Prismo</b>: You've gotta wake up Jake and then...umm, you'll see.

<b>Finn</b>: I'll see what, Prismo?

<b>Prismo</b>: Shoot, I don't know if I thought this thing all the way through..

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>shocked</i>] Whaaaat?

<b>Prismo</b>: Aw, it'll be cool. [<i>nervously</i>] It'll be cool.

[<i>Jake snores while sleeping in the bed</i>]

<b>Revived Prismo</b>: Dude, I can't believe I died. Jake I'm sorry man. This doesn't feel right.

<b>Past Prismo</b>: [<i>appearing with Finn</i>] Ok, go wake Jake up and bring him back here [<i>Finn gives the thumbs up and runs to the bed</i>]

<b>Revived Prismo</b>: Whoa, Finn, hey, are you gonna wake up Jake?

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though?

<b>Revived Prismo</b>: My past self is doing plan B right?

<b>Finn</b>: Uh, yes. Although I gotta say that this is as rickety as yoga balls.

<b>Revived Prismo</b>: Yeah, tell me about it.

<b>Finn</b>: You tell you about it!

<b>Revived Prismo</b>: I think you would blow up if I did that.

<b>Finn</b>: Well, anyway, here I go. [<i>shakes Jake</i>] Hey, Jake, wake up.

[<i>Jake groans sleepily</i>]

<b>Revived Prismo</b>: I'm out. [<i>vanishes</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>sleepily</i>] Hey, Finn, what's going on?

<b>Finn</b>: We gotta bounce.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>pushing Finn away</i>] No, bro, don't tear me away from nirvana. Wait, nooo! [<i>falls to floor</i>] Oof! [<i>normal voice</i>] I'm okay now.

<b>Finn</b>: Cool [<i>leading Jake back to Past Prismo</i>] this way!

<b>Past Jake</b>: Whoa! Rrrm, wait a minute... What is this!?

<b>Jake</b>: Prismo?! You're alive! [<i>hugs Prismo's nose on the wall</i>]

<b>Prismo</b>: Well, not yet. Finn, in a second you've gotta stop yourself from waking up Jake.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>confused</i>] Stop my who?

<b>Prismo</b>: [<i>panicked</i>] Shoot! Hide!

[<i>Jake flattens himself and covers Finn into the wall, fortunately Jake is the same color as the wall</i>]

<b>Past Finn</b>: Think we should turn around somewhere, I feel like we're lost.

<b>Past Prismo</b>: No I was just stalling, don't think about it, c'mon, this way.

<b>Prismo</b>: THAT who.

[<i>Finn pushes his extended tongue back into his mouth</i>]

<b>Prismo</b>: But wait, Jake, that means one of your alternate reality incarnations will sleep for eternity to keep me alive.

<b>Jake</b>: Cool, dude!

<b>Prismo</b>: OK, Finn, I'm not sure what'll happen if you confront yourself. He might explode.

<b>Finn</b>: 'He', me or other me?

<b>Prismo</b>: You know what? Forget it.

<b>Finn</b>: Shut it Prismo, heroes risk everything for their friends. Although I admit you're more Jake's friend than mine. Sometimes you can think someone is totally cool, but you never become besties. Now I don't know why that happens, but regardless let's do this. [<i>dashes out after his past self</i>]

<b>Prismo</b>: Good luck!

[<i>Past Finn walks up the bed to revive Jake</i>]

<b>Revived Prismo</b>: Whoa, Finn, hey! Are you gonna wake up Jake?

<b>Past Finn</b>: [<i>while Finn walks up behind him</i>] Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though?

<b>Prismo</b>: My past self is doing plan B, right?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>tapping Past Finn on the shoulder</i>] PLAN B!

<b>Past Finn</b>: [<i>shocked</i>] What the—!? [<i>explodes into light and a sword appears in the center</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>grabbing the sword</i>]This is me? This sword is me?

<b>Prismo</b>: Finn sword, dude.

<b>Finn</b>: Welcome back, Prismo.

<b>Prismo</b>: Thank you, Finn.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Sticking his head out and giving the thumbs up</i>] Welcome back, Prismo.

<b>Prismo</b>: Thank you, Jake.
