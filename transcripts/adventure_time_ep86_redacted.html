[<i>Finn giggles</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, well...then...why would you say that?

<b>Finn</b>:  Ice King, we know you did it!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yeah... let me introduce you to my new wife. [<i>Ice King removes a cloak from a shadowed figure revealing a grotesque Frankenstein's monster-like mash-up of all the princesses, making Finn and Jake gasp.</i>] Oh, wait...you mean I'm the guy stealing all the p— Yeah, okay, I get it now.

<b>Princess Monster Wife</b>:  Is there something wrong with me? The way I am...it's not normal... is it?

<b>Ice King</b>:  Oh... pretty baby wife. You're the most normal thing in my whole life. We're like two normal jelly beans sitting at the bottom of the jar, floating in a sea of olives, waiting for somebody to guess how many jelly beans are in the jar... which I mentioned.

<b>Princess Monster Wife</b>:  I don't think I understand...

<b>Ice King</b>:  Just look into my eyes and know that everything is okay.

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Entering kitchen</i>] Hey, hey, hey....

<b>Princess Monster Wife</b>:  Monster! A monster!

<b>Ice King</b>:  What's going on in here? Nobody's a monster! All I see in this room is a young, kind-hearted, intelligent, hot-looking ice king, and his beautiful princess bride! That's you, sweetie...

<b>Ice King</b>:  Don't rearrange the chairs please. You're all gonna clap and cheer or I'm gonna smack your buns. [<i>Princess Monster Wide walks out onto the runway wearing the outfit Ice King created for her as penguins clap.</i>] Whoo! Yeah! ...

[<i>To penguins</i>] Clap louder, you gotta be all like "whoo!"

[<i>Penguins clap louder, and Finn and Jake arrive carrying mirrors.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  If we look at her with these mirrors, her ugliness will have no effect on us.

<b>Jake</b>:  Where is she? Oh! I think she's right over...

[<i>Both Finn and Jake once again pass out upon seeing her. As she blows a kiss to one of the penguins, he vomits causing her to cry and run out.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Hey!

[<i>Ice King is now standing at Princess Monster Wife's door.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Baby, do you want to talk about it?

<b>Princess Monster Wife</b>:  You should just find another princess to marry. I'm unlovable!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Girl, I love you as much as all of the other princesses in the world combined!

<b>Princess Monster Wife</b>:  You don't really mean that...

<b>Ice King</b>:  I'll prove it! See, you have Elbow Princess's hips, and Dr. Princess's heart and intestines, Slime Princess's bottom... You have all my favorite parts of my favorite princesses!

[<i>Princess Monster Wife opens the door.</i>]

<b>Princess Monster Wife</b>:  [<i>Crying</i>] I'm just a bunch of stolen parts?!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, the parts don't matter. It's you that matters.

<b>Princess Monster Wife</b>:  But... who am I?

<b>Ice King</b>:  You're my wife! And I will always love my wife no matter what!

<b>Princess Monster Wife</b>:  You'd love me, even without these other princess's parts?

<b>Ice King</b>:  Sure, baby, even without all your fine lady parts. Now give us a hug.

[<i>They hug. Finn and Jake arrive wearing blindfolds.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, Ice King!

<b>Jake</b>:  Your wife's face can't make us faint anymore!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Don't listen to them babe; they're being negative! Run, my happiness! I'll distract them with ice magic!

[<i>Ice King nibbles on Jake's arm.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Ouch.

[<i>Finn and Jake tackle Ice King into submission.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Do you give up?!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yes! I give up...

<b>Jake</b>:  Finally... let's get those princess parts back to the ladies.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, mans. Wait... where'd your wife go?

[<i>Princess Monster Wife returns all the stolen parts including Princess Bubblegum's face, Hot Dog Princess's body and Wildberry Princess's arm, but misplaces Turtle Princess's face with Lumpy Space Princess's, as her spirit then returns to the Ice Kingdom.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh?

<b>Ice King</b>:  Let me go! Let me go!

<b>Princess Monster Wife's spirit</b>:  Though my parts be scattered, I will always be your wife.

<b>Ice King</b>:  She... she... gave away all my stuff!
