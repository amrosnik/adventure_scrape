<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Okay. I'm going to lower the screen. Tell me what you see.

<b>Finn</b>:  Crunchy, you look like a rainbow! It's beautiful! Can you guys see that?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Nope. Only you can see it because you're hooked up to the aura visualizer. But actually I'm lying. We can see everything you see on this screen. Now I'm gonna send that image into Crunchy.

<b>Crunchy</b>:  Whoa!

<b>Finn</b>:  The aura's gone!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Except... [<i>lifts monitor away, aura is still visible around Crunchy</i>] Crunchy's true essence manifested in the material plane!

<b>Finn</b>:  I wanna see Peppermint Butler's aura!

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>:  [<i>chuckles</i>] You don't wanna see that!

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, we do! Right, Princess?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Sure, Finn! Just let me re-calibrate the device!

<b>Jake</b>:  No! Bunk that, I'm tired! C'mon, Finn!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, yeah. Yeah, me and Jake, we gotta peace out.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  G'night!

[<i>Finn and Jake walk down the dark hallway, to hear beeping noises coming from the <a href="/wiki/Banana_Guard" title="Banana Guard" class="mw-redirect">Banana Guard</a>'s monitoring room. They curiously pop in.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey- what's goin' on in here? Yo, guys!

<b>Banana Guards</b>:  Hey, Finn!

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa, what's that? Security cams?

<b>Banana Guard 1</b>:  Yeah, man! You gotta see some crazy stuff—

<b>Banana Guards</b>:  Show you what?

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  What you said!

<b>Banana Guards</b>:  We didn't say nothin'!

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  Too late for take-backs! We practically know everything already! Now show us!

<b>Banana Guard 1</b>:  Okay, but you can't tell anyone.

<b>Banana Guard 2</b>:  Yeah, this is our weird secret.

<b>Jake</b>:  Of course, dude!

<b>Banana Guard 1</b>:  All right. Now look at monitor three. Can you see it?

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, yeah! That's, uh... Who is that?

<b>Jake</b>:  That's <a href="/wiki/Candy_Person_2" title="Candy Person 2">Chocoberry</a>. Why are you guys spyin' on Chocoberry?

<b>Banana Guard 2</b>:  No, man! Look there, in the corner!

<b>Finn</b>:  Who's that?

<b>Banana Guard 1</b>:  This is our weird secret, okay? Remember that!

[<i>Scene cuts to the Guard Room a few minutes into the future. In front of the monitors sits an angry Princess Bubblegum, flanked by a group of upset <a href="/wiki/Candy_People" title="Candy People">Candy People</a>, who are shouting angrily.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  How long has this been going on?

<b>Banana Guard 1</b>:  He's shown up every night for the past two weeks!

<b>Banana Guard 2</b>:  He goes to different rooms and just stands there!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  And you didn't tell me?!

<b>Banana Guard 1</b>:  If we told you, then we knew you'd mess up our weird TV show!

<b>Banana Guard 2</b>:  Banana guarding is boring!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  I'm gonna talk to him.

<b>Banana Guard 1</b>:  Oh, no! Ya see?!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Sorry, guys!

<b>Finn</b>:  What are we gonna do?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Something totally bum-slops.

[<i>The scene cuts to daytime. Princess Bubblegum has assembled her Candy People together for a meeting. They are all chanting in protest.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Jake, please! What is your second demand?

<b>Toughy</b>:  We want the big cash money wad! Enough to provide for our delinquent mothers, so that hopefully they'll show us the love we always dreamed about in our sad, young lives!

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmm.

[<i>The scene cuts to Princess Bubblegum, who is viewing the bedrooms on the security cameras. She is looking into Crunchy's room, speaking into a microphone.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Crunchy, wake up, Crunchy.

<b>Crunchy</b>:  Aaagh... Glob? Is that you?

<b>Finn</b>:  No sign of Lemongrab for three days! I think it worked!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Maybe... Let's keep looking. [<i>Flips through various views, and finally sees Lemongrab standing before a sleeping Starchie, his hands clasped behind his back.</i>] Awww, geez! [<i>Princess Bubblegum leaves the monitor room and goes to Starchie's room.</i>] Hey!

<b>Earl of Lemongrab</b>:  [<i>sleepily</i>] Nhuh?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  What happened to your new citizens?

<b>Earl of Lemongrab</b>:  [<i>sleepily and monotonously</i>] They didn't understand my lemon stylez. I like this way better.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Hmmm... I wonder if you don't understand their candy stylez! C'mon, lemme show you something!

[<i>The scene cuts to daytime. Princess Bubblegum, Lemongrab, and Crunchy are sitting on a bench beneath a billowy pink tree. Finn and Jake sit close by, watching contently.</i>]

<b>Lemon Camel</b>:  MOOO!!! [<i>Lemon Camel leaps up, and Lemongrab rides away on the terrified creature.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Man, that guy's a real D-list!

He abruptly closes the door on them, and walks over to his control panel to shock them, smiling gleefully and talking softly in a tranquil fury.</i>]

<b>Earl of Lemongrab</b>:  This is <i>serious</i>! Pup Gang got four units... Maaaybe... Maybe ten units for trespassers? [<i>He shocks Finn, Jake, and the Pup Gang, who scream in agony. Jake lifts up his arm to reach them to the top of the chamber through the air vent.</i>] YOU GOT TRICKS, HUH?! YOU GOTTA FALL DOWN SOMETIME! AND WHEN YOU DO, TWELVE UNITS!
