[<i>The episode opens at the Tree Fort</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; BMO</b>: Birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday [<i>chant a bit faster</i>], birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, [<i>Jake goes over to the cake and eats it whole</i>] birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday! Yeah! Yay!

<b>Finn</b>: Nice job, Mr. Birthday Boy.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>with his mouth full</i>] Thanks.

<b>Finn</b>: Man, you are like another year older, but you look good. Like, <i>super</i> good.

<b>Jake</b>: Yup. Mom and dad passed down some pretty good genes.

<b>Finn</b>: Oh yeah, mom and dad. Hey, did mom and dad tell you any stories about when you were born?

<b>BMO</b>: Yay! Birthday story time, please.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>chuckles</i>] Well, [<i>camera goes down to his stomach, Jake rubs his stomach as if he were pregnant</i>] it was a day like any other day...[<i>flashbacks to Margaret, who is rubbing her stomach, the puppies in it move</i>]

<b>Margaret</b>: There, there, baby. You're going to be a fighter. [<i>holds up a crossbow</i>] Just like your mother. [<i>shoots a bow at the door, sees that she got the right target</i>] Yes! [<i>gets on the floor</i>] Barrel roll. [<i>shoots and arrow at the ceiling</i>] Ugh! [<i>gets up, shoots an arrow to the right</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: [<i>comes out of the kitchen with two plates with steak on them</i>] Steak break.

<b>Margaret</b>: Let's get started. [<i>sets her crossbow down, Joshua sets the plates on the table</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: These steaks are tough and stringy. Like you.

<b>Margaret</b>: Oh, good one, dear. [<i>Joshua starts cutting her steak</i>] Hey, after dinner, what do you say we check the ticker-type for new cases?

<b>Joshua</b>: Margaret, you're in a family way now. You should take a backseat from investigations.

<b>Margaret</b>: Oh, come on, Joshua. Even with this ankle-biter, I'm as quick as ever. Sure, my waist is bigger, but that just means more bullets in my ammo belt.

<b>Joshua</b>: You're missing the point, sugar. What if something bad happens? Let's say we're out on the beat, fighting some lowlife. He takes a punch, you zig when you should've zagged, and oops! Junior takes a knock to the noodle, comes out with the shiner the size of a grapefruit. I can't take that kind of guilt and neither can you.

<b>Margaret</b>: I can take care of myself just fine. And besides, these babies [<i>taps her fork on her stomach</i>] don't come cheap. We need to work together as a team to bring in the bread. [<i>puts her fork in Joshua's mouth</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: [<i>chews the steak from Margaret's fork</i>] Yeah, you got me there.

<b>Margaret</b>: Now let's get over to that ticker-type and look for some perps.

<b>Joshua</b>: You relax, dear, I got it. [<i>does a flip over the table, walks to the ticker-type and looks at it</i>] Hmm. Let's get a look here. "<a href="/wiki/Marceline" title="Marceline">Vampire girl</a> spotted in the <a href="/wiki/Grass_Lands" title="Grass Lands">Grass Lands</a> harassing sheep and cattle." Nope, nope, nope. "<a href="/wiki/Flame_Princess" title="Flame Princess">Small fire goblin</a> burns down <a href="/wiki/Candy_Kingdom" title="Candy Kingdom">Candy Kingdom</a> forest."

<b>Margaret</b>: Hey, that sounds fun. Let's do that.

<b>Joshua</b>: Wait, wait, here's one. "<a href="/wiki/Tree_Trunks_(character)" title="Tree Trunks (character)"> Woman's</a> <a href="/wiki/Apple_Pie_(food)" title="Apple Pie (food)">pies</a> go missing in Bucolic Countryside where nothing ever happens." The perfect case for my pregnant wife!

<b>Margaret</b>: What?

<b>Joshua</b>: Now let's get an egg in our shoe and beat it. [<i>shows them driving to Tree Trunks' house, they park their car and go to the door, Margaret knocks on it</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>opens the door</i>] Yes? Hello?

<b>Joshua</b>: [<i>fixes his tie</i>] Afternoon, Mrs. Tree Trunks. We're Joshua and Margaret of <i>Joshua and Margaret Investigations</i>. And this is [<i>pats Margaret's stomach</i>] our boy. We're responding to a wire about missing pies.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, yes. A-a-a monster's been stealing my pies off of the windowsill.

<b>Joshua</b>: A monster, eh?

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, yes, you can see the monster [<i>Joshua and Margaret turn to the tracks</i>] tracks leading off into the forest.

<b>Joshua</b>: Well, those tracks are as phony as a three dollar bill.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: The monster tracks are very real. [<i>shows <a href="/wiki/Wyatt" title="Wyatt">Wyatt</a> climbing into the window with snow shoes on his feet and holding a pie pan</i>] My husband told me so. [<i>Wyatt grunts, and falls in the window onto the floor</i>] Wyatt!

<b>Wyatt</b>: Aw, aw geez. You got me.

<b>Joshua</b>: [<i>him and Margaret step inside</i>] What's the big idea, Wyatt? Why'd you burgle your wife's pie?

<b>Wyatt</b>: Because it's amazing! Oh, I can't get enough of it.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: You could just ask for seconds.

<b>Wyatt</b>: But I want thirds and fourths! I want to stop when I want to stop!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, Wyatt.

<b>Wyatt</b>: [<i>crying</i>] Oh, it's the only good part of my day.

<b>Joshua</b>: Well, there you have it. The only monster here was this man's appetite for his wife's pie.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, no. But the monster <i>is</i> real. He snuck up and rubbed my elbow while I was gardening. And <a href="/wiki/Colonel_Candy_Corn" title="Colonel Candy Corn">Leftenant Candy Corn</a> said it came in through the window and touched him on the chest. Oh! Oh, now I got myself all scared. W-won't you check around to make sure no one is out there?

<b>Joshua</b>: Of course. Probably nothing more than a peeper. [<i>they step out of the house</i>] Ha! These country yokels are all just superstitious. I bet you that old elephant sees a monster a day.

<b>Margaret</b>: Joshua, look! [<i>puts her paw in the track</i>] Something way larger than Wyatt made them. These tracks look real.

<b>Joshua</b>: Hot cram! A peeping monster! Oh, this town would surely put up a collection to nab this guy. Oh, too bad you're preggo. We got to pass. [<i>turns around and starts walking away</i>]

<b>Margaret</b>: Come on, Joshua! [<i>follows the tracks</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: What? [<i>follows Margaret</i>]

<b>Margaret</b>: Ha ha!

<b>Joshua</b>: Margaret! Margaret! Wait for Pappy! [<i>a blue owl turns its head around, showing it has four eyes, the owl hoots</i>]

<b>Margaret</b>: Hmm. The tracks end here.

<b>Joshua</b>: [<i>a bush rustles, a blue cat comes out of it, Joshua growls and shakes his fists at it, the cat circles Margaret and looks at her stomach and pokes it</i>] Hey, hey! Beat it, uggos! [<i>stomps, the cat yowls and hisses, another bush rustles, the creature peeks out then disappears</i>] The peeper! [<i>follows it, goes through a hole in the middle of two trees</i>]

<b>Margaret</b>: I'll show that peepsie the pepper! [<i>tries going through the hole, but can't, tries getting out of it</i>] Joshua, dear, I'm stuck! [<i>the creature growls and comes out from behind a bush behind Margaret</i>] Joshua! The beast outflanked us! [<i>the monster screeches</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: Gads! [<i>the monster screeches, Joshua goes and punches it</i>] Boom! [<i>the monster picks him up</i>] Do your worst, you masher.

<b>Margaret</b>: Joshua! [<i>grunts, gets herself out of the hole, the monster sniffs Joshua, opens its mouth and puts Joshua's head in its mouth, Margaret gasps and takes a needle out of her hat, goes and stabs it in the monster's butt</i>] Drop that daddy! [<i>the monster screeches, gets on all four legs and runs behind a bush, leaving green slime behind it</i>] Baby cakes! Oh, this is all my fault!

<b>Joshua</b>: Uh, yeah, pretty much.

[<i>scene changes back to their home, Joshua has a bandage wrapped around his head and eating a sandwich, Margaret is pacing back and forth, looking worried</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: Ah, good last meal. Okay, well, I got bit by a monster, a creature of the night. We both know what comes next for me. [<i>picks up a sword and sets it on the table</i>] Just make it snappy, darling.

<b>Margaret</b>: [<i>tearing up</i>] Don't. [<i>sniffles</i>] Don't be melodramatic, Joshua. [<i>holding the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Poisons" title="Book of Poisons">Book of Poisons</a></i>] I've been doing some research. Listen here. I think if we can get a sample of that creature's venom, we can use it to synthesize an antidote. [<i>a thud noise is heard</i>] Joshua?! [<i>drops the book, goes to Joshua</i>] Oh! Puddin' Pie!

<b>Joshua</b>: [<i>groans</i>] I'm fine. Just got to pop out and fetch that venom.

<b>Margaret</b>: You're about as fine as a canary in a cat mine! [<i>goes and takes Joshua to a pull-out bed, lays him on it, goes to a candle on the wall and pulls it down, opening a hidden door to the weapon room, she goes in and grabs a crossbow and arrows, puts her belt on that reads "Top Dawg," goes and puts her hat on a mannequin head and grabs her other hat, the puppies in her womb move</i>] Oof! Hey, where's the fire, kiddo? You stay put. [<i>goes back to Joshua, who is asleep and mumbling, Margaret holds up a walkie-talkie</i>] So's I can keep tabs on you. [<i>sets the walkie-talkie next to Joshua's ear</i>] Feel better. Over. [<i>kisses Joshua's cheek and leaves</i>]

[<i>scene changes to Margaret parking next to the forest, she parks the car, gets out and turns a flashlight on and looks around</i>]

<b>Margaret</b>: [<i>walking through the forest</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: [<i>through the walkie-talkie</i>] Come in, Margaret. Do you read me? Over.

<b>Margaret</b>: [<i>turns around, goes by a trail of green slime</i>] I got the peep peep's trail. In pursuit. [<i>shines her flashlight at trees</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: You have to say "over" or I think you're still talking. Over.

<b>Margaret</b>: [<i>shining her flashlight at an old building that reads "<a href="/wiki/Pantheon_Of_Savings" title="Pantheon Of Savings" class="mw-redirect">Pantheon of Savings</a>" </i>] Joshua, I've stumbled upon the beast's lair. [<i>shows Joshua's walkie-talkie on the floor</i>] Just hang on, Honey Bunny. Over. [<i>Joshua steps on the walkie-talkie, breaking it, growling from the pain he feels in his head, lays on the table and breaks it, a blue bump starts to grow on his head, the bump throbs, Joshua howls like a wolf, scene goes back to Margaret looking around in the building, a shadowy figure passes her, she turns and shines the flashlight at the <a href="/wiki/Shape-shifter" title="Shape-shifter" class="mw-redirect">creature</a>, Margaret gaps, the monster makes a noise</i>] Stay right there. [<i>shoots an arrow at the creature, the creature shapeshifts so he steps back before the arrow can hit him</i>] What?! [<i>shoots two arrows at the creature, the creature jumps next to Margaret, the two arrows hit a rock, the creature shapeshifts into a cat and meows, then into an owl and hoots, then into a monster with more eyes and it punches Margaret backwards, making her fall on her back, the puppies in her stomach move</i>] Ooh! Not yet! [<i>tries reaching for her crossbow, but can't, the creature shapeshifts into a bigger creature and stretches its head towards Margaret, Margaret keeps trying to reach for her crossbow</i>] Come on, come on! [<i>grabs the crossbow's handle and shoots an arrow above the monster's head, hitting a box of baby items, sending them rumbling and crashing onto the monster. Defeated, the monster groans and shapeshifts into a baby with three eyes and coos</i>] What? What's your angle, slick? You poison my hubby, then play the innocent? [<i>shines her flashlight at the baby items around the room</i>] And what's with all this baby paraphernalia? Wait a tick. Are you a baby?

<b>Monster</b>: [<i>shifts its eyes left and right</i>] Uh-huh.

<b>Margaret</b>: Oh, no! I must've scared the dickens out of you! [<i>the monster sits on the floor and coos</i>] There, there, baby. I'm so sorry...[<i>they both tear up</i>] For <i>this!</i> [<i>punches the monster's face and puts a test tube under its mouth, making its venom go into the tube. Margaret gets up and starts stepping out of the building</i>] I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [<i>the monster's eye stretches and looks out the door, the monster shapeshifts into its normal shape and chuckles in an evil "</i>You haven't seen the last of me<i>" tone, then shapeshifts into another shape and shoots lasers from its face diodes at the air, opening a portal. The monster shapeshifts into a circle and stretches into the portal, and the portal closes, the scene changes back to their home, Margaret goes inside (which is more of a mess than before)</i>] Joshua, I got the venom! [<i>the puppies move</i>] Ohhh! Uh oh, this baby business is getting SERIOUS! [<i>breathes carefully and walks into the kitchen, looks out the window, showing Joshua standing by the wall</i>] Joshua! [<i>the puppies move more</i>] Ohhh! Ohhh! [<i>breathes carefully, goes out the window and steps off the dumpster, goes by Joshua</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: Margaret, stay away. [<i>turns around and points at the bump on his head</i>] Something's about to happen!

<b>Margaret</b>: [<i>the puppies move a lot</i>] Something's about to happen with <i>me</i> too! [<i>they both yelp</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: Margaret! [<i>his throbbing bump stretches and makes a splat noise. Margaret drops the test tube (not that she'll be needing the venom now).</i>] Shine the light, dear. [<i>Margaret turns the flashlight on and aims it at his head with a recently burst mutant bump.</i>] Yowzers! [<i>Margaret shines the light at the ground, showing a puppy Jake, spawned out of Joshua's venom bump and freshly drenched in a pond of biofluid.</i>]

<b>Puppy Jake</b>: [<i>gets up and sings</i>] Hello, daddy. [<i>turns to Margaret</i>] Hello, mommy. [<i>does a little dance</i>] It's so nice to be here with you now. [<i>falls and goes to sleep and snores, shows Margaret and Joshua looking shocked (if <b>that</b> isn't messed up, what <b>is</b>?), Margaret drops the flashlight and the second puppy moves a lot - and that is how Jake's little brother Jermaine came to the world...</i>]

[<i>screen goes black, scene changes to Joshua and Margaret walking in a forest, Joshua is pushing a stroller with Jake and Jermaine in it</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: Boy, Jake left a scar on my head the size of a nickel. I'll have to wear a hat now, Margaret.

<b>Margaret</b>: [<i>takes a fedora out and puts it on Joshua</i>] Well, I think you'll look good in one. [<i>shows the puppies in the stroller, sleeping</i>] Are you sure having him next to <a href="/wiki/Jermaine" title="Jermaine" class="mw-redirect">Jermaine</a> is safe? We don't even know <i>what</i> he is. [<i>Puppy Jake smacks his lips</i>]

<b>Joshua</b>: Of course we do, dear. He's our boy.

<b>Margaret</b>: That he is.

<b>Joshua</b>: Yes, we've got one boy that <i>I</i> gave birth to and one boy that <i>you</i> gave birth to. Let's never tell him how it happened.

<b>Margaret</b>: Agreed.

[<i>scene changes back to Finn, Jake, and BMO in the present</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: And so they never told me.

<b>Finn</b>: Never told you <i>what?</i>

<b>Jake</b>: I don't know. They never told me. Ha!
