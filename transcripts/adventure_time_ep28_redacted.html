<b>Jake</b>:  Don't worry, princess. We're gonna get you out of here. [<i>All three exit the castle by sliding down the castle's ice path on a sled.</i>] Whoo-hoo! yeah! yeah!

[<i>Goes to the window to yell.</i>] Well, it's your mistake, missy! This Ice King is gonna be fine!

<b>Slime Princess</b>:  Excuse me for approaching you, sir. You just seem so approachable. [<i>Giggles.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Chuckles.</i>] That's funny, usually my looks put people off.

<b>Slime Princess</b>:  [<i>Giggles.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Looks around the area.</i>] Is someone paying you to do this?

<b>Slime Princess</b>:  [<i>Giggles harder and waves her arms.</i>] Tell me about yourself.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Well, there's not much to tell, really. I'm an ice king.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Ladies, I'll have time to meet you individually later, please just, just stop squirming.

<b><a href="/wiki/Turtle_Princess" title="Turtle Princess">Turtle Princess</a></b>:  But this looks like a prison.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Prison? Don't be ridiculous! It's a... waiting room! Stop squirming.

<b>Finn</b>:  You're the nice king, right?

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Relaxes</i>] Oh yeah, I keep forgetting that.

<b>Finn</b>:  Who do you want us to nice knight against?

<b>Space Angel Princess</b>:  Nice King, I love you!

<b>Engagement Ring Princess</b>:  Did I tell you that I like the opera? But if you don't, I hate it!

<b>Princesses</b>:  Nice King!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Angrily flares up.</i>] Please! I'm trying to tell my Nice Knights something! [<i>This causes everyone to gasp loudly.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Chuckles nervously</i>] Come here. [<i>He huddles with Finn &amp; Jake.</i>] The main enemy to the Nice King right now is the disorganization of his love life.

<b>Finn</b>:  W-well, what do you mean?

<b>Ice King</b>:  The ugly ones are all mixed up with the other ones! I need you to catalog them... or something.

<b>Jake</b>:  Tah ha, but we punch monsters.

<b>Ice King</b>:  After I choose my bride, then you can go punch the monsters.

<b>Finn</b>:  Managing admirers? We'll give it a try...

[<i>Scene: Finn and Jake interview the princesses.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Bee_Princess" title="Bee Princess">Bee Princess</a></b>:  Um, am I supposed to?

<b>Jake</b>:  She's dodging the question.

<b>Bee Princess</b>:  [<i>Faints</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Ghost_Princess_(character)" title="Ghost Princess (character)">Ghost Princess</a></b>:  I'm really nervous right now... I-I just really want to meet a nice king.

<b>Jake</b>:  You can go back to the waiting room now, ma'am!

<b>Ghost Princess</b>:  I screwed it up, didn't I! [<i>Cries and runs away.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  I think we did a good job.

<b>Finn</b>:  I don't feel good making a princess cry, this is not how knights are suppose to act.

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn, knights are loyal to their king.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm still not sure...

<b>Jake</b>:  Aa Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! Loyalty to the King! [<i>Pats Finn's shoulder.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Can't argue with that!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Calling from a top the sand castle window.</i>] Hey, Nice Knights, Turtle Princess is about to walk out that door, I told her that I like her a lot, but I really don't like her all that much, could you guys break it off for me?

<b>Jake</b>:  Get out of here!

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  [<i>Cries and runs away.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Alright! We did it, dude! [<i>Pats Finn's forehead.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Sighs</i>] I feel terrible, I need to talk to the Nice King about this.

[<i>Scene: inside the sand castle, Ice King is riding on Hot Dog Princess while balancing himself with Skeleton Princess and Purple Princess walking on the sides.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yes, yes, keep walking in a circle. [<i>Muffled laugh.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Nice King, may I speak with you for a moment?

<b>Ice King</b>:  Princesses, I must speak with my knight in private. Go on back into your cage.

<b>Princesses</b>:  Bye, Nice King. [<i>Giggling</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  What's up, knight?

<b>Finn</b>:  I don't like treating princesses this way, I don't wanna... I don't wanna do this anymore.

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Seething anger</i>] Your loyalty is in question?

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, it's not that. It's just, princesses are suppose to be treated with niceness.

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Pinching at Finn's body</i>] Are you implying that I'm not the nice king!

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, what's wrong with you!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Hey, I'm here.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Ugh, Finn, get rid of her.

<b>Finn</b>:  What?! No, man!

<b>Ice King</b>:  She's too loud and lumpy, I like smooth princesses... smoo-o-o-oth. [<i>mimes curvy body shape with his hands.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  I can be smooth! [<i>Begins pulling at her lumps.</i>] Finn, punch out my lumps.

<b>Finn</b>:  What?!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  I can be whatever he wants! I can change!

<b>Finn</b>:  I can't punch a princess!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Gaah! Finn, just punch her! Let me see what she looks like... smoo-o-o-oth.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oooo...

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Yes! Hit me, hit me, hit me!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Raises his fist, but stops.</i>] Uuh, I'm sorry, Lumpy Space Princess, I just can't punch you!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Are you serious?! Fine, I'll do it myself. [<i>Begins to punch down her lumps.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Princess no!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Wait a minute Nice Knight, let's see what she can do. [<i>As Lumpy Space Princess continues to punch herself, Finn covers his eyes.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  There, how's that? Better? [<i>Is now shaped like a ball.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Meh, no, I-I don't like her.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  This is all your fault, Finn! [<i>Floats away.</i>] Aaaaaah!

<b>Finn</b>:  King, I'm sorry, I just can't do this anymore: punching princesses, breaking hearts, eh- it just doesn't seem nice at all.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Hey! You're on thin ice Nice Knight! [<i>A beard whisker sprouts from his cheek.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh?

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, wow, awesome! What is it?

<b>Ice King</b>:  The Ice King <i>stole</i> my razor, sneak into his trap-filled ice castle and retrieve it. [<i>Speaking rapidly</i>] And don't look through the shoebox he keeps behind the laundry bag in the closet.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wha?!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Those are my orders!

<b>Finn</b>:  Yes, finally something knight-like!

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Exiting the castle on Jake's back as he stretches through an opening.</i>] Get ready, Ice King, for battle!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>With palms glowing he manifest floating snow creatures.</i>] And once I have my razor, I can select my elite army of wives and take over the world!

[<i>Scene: at the Ice Kingdom, Finn and Jake sneak around end to the bathroom, which still has a pile of white beard hair on the floor.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa, Jake, look at all his hair.

<b>Jake</b>:  Did this Ice King shave his back or something?

<b>Finn</b>:  Ha ha! [<i>Gasps as he spots the razor.</i>] The Nice King's razor [<i>Clicks it on.</i>], Jake, look, check this out- Aaaah! [<i>He encounters Jake's face covered in a white beard.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Relax, dude, it's just me.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Clicks of razor.</i>] Ha ha, you look just like the Ice King. [<i>Covers face with beard hair.</i>] And so do I.

<b>Jake</b>:  Heh hee heh. These whiskers would make anyone look like the Ice King.

<b>Finn</b>:  Ha haa, yeah, even the Nice King!

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Gasp</i>] The Nice King is the Ice King!

[<i>Scene: back at the sand castle the Ice King sits on a chair looking into a mirror.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Ugh, what do the princesses see in this face? Hope I can keep this going. So many princesses to meet. [<i>Suddenly a whisker sprouts from his cheek.</i>] Whiskers! [<i>He pulls.</i>] I can't be growing whiskers now! [<i>More continue to sprout faster than he can pull them out.</i>] Daaarrr, I haven't picked who I want to marry me!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Calling from outside.</i>] Nice King!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Did you retrieve my stole razor?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah and also <i>this</i>! [<i>Finn &amp; Jake hold up Ice King's beard hair.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  My beard! I-I-I mean what is that?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Pfft, he knows what it is!

<b>Finn</b>:  Let's get him Jake! [<i>As they bot walk to the castle, they are stopped by Lumpy Space Princess, who is backed by the other Princesses.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Stop! We're not gonna let you beat up the Nice King.

<b>Finn</b>:  He's not the Nice King, he's the Ice King!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  We don't believe you!
