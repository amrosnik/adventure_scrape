<b>Finn</b>: Tree Trunks! The slumber party is about to start. Get those hot buns in here, girl!

[<i>Mr. Pig takes this the wrong way, and, enraged, runs up the steps toward Finn.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Did you hear me? I said, "Get those hot—"!

[<i>Mr. Pig slaps Finn.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hi, Mr. Pig.

[<i>Mr. Pig slaps him again.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Why are you hitting me?

[<i>Mr. Pig slaps him once more.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: I was just talking about Tree Trunks's hot—.

[<i>Mr. Pig slaps him one last time. He takes Tree Trunks's basket and sets it down, then takes his wife by the trunk and leads her back down the steps. <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a> runs up to Finn.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Come on, Finn! We're doing music chairs.

[<i>The two run over to a group of <a href="/wiki/Candy_People" title="Candy People">Candy People</a> who are about to start a round of musical chairs.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Chet" title="Chet">Chet</a></b>: Everyone ready?

<b>Everyone</b>: Ready!

[<i>Chet cranks a phonograph, which plays some lively music. Then he suddenly stops.</i>]

<b>Chet</b>: Take a seat!

[<i>Everyone sits down except Finn and Princess Bubblegum, who run around the circle of chairs searching for a spot.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Uh, uh...

<b>Finn</b>: Uh-oh, uh-oh!

<b><a href="/wiki/Candy_Person_3" title="Candy Person 3">Mr. Cupcake</a></b>: There's a seat by me.

[<i>Finn and Princess Bubblegum lunge at the empty chair at the same time, bumping each other.</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh! Heh.

<b>Finn</b>: You take it, Princess. This is your party.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: You take it, Finn. You're my guest.

<b>Finn &amp; Princess Bubblegum</b>: No, no, I insist!

<b>Chet</b>: Time is up. You two must now be sent to the closest closet to have heavenly thoughts.

[<i>Everyone walks over to a door. Chet pushes Finn and Princess Bubblegum inside.</i>]

<b>Chet</b>: Heavenly thoughts. [<i>shuts door</i>]

[<i>Finn and Princess Bubblegum sit down.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, PB.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Hey, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>puts a toothpick in his mouth</i>] Mm?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Bup, bup, bup. Hey, you wanna ditch the party and go for a walk?

<b>Finn</b>: Wha—? Really?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: It's been a while since we just hung out, you know?

<b>Finn</b>: What about the Candy People?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Ah, they should be fine, right? For once? Maybe they'll surprise me by being fine. Come on. [<i>pushes aside some coats</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Secret passage.

<b>Finn</b>: Noice.

<b><a href="/wiki/Crunchy" title="Crunchy">Crunchy</a></b>: Someone should listen at the door.

[<i>The Candy People whisper among themselves, some pointing to Crunchy.</i>]

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>: We nominate you, Crunchy, to go listen at the door.

<b><a href="/wiki/Dr._Donut" title="Dr. Donut">Dr. Donut</a></b>: And tell everybody what's going on.

<b><a href="/wiki/Gumdrop_Lass_1" title="Gumdrop Lass 1">Gumdrop Lass 1</a></b>: What do you hear?

<b>Dr. Donut</b>: Yeah, paint us a picture, Crunchy.

<b>Crunchy</b>: I hear, like, uh, like, a lush, green field... next to a white picket fence. Finn and the princess both brought picnic baskets. Oh, but they brought the same stuff, and they're laughing about it. And now they're kissing.

<b><a href="/wiki/Candy_Person_2" title="Candy Person 2">Chocoberry</a></b>: There's no lush, green field in that closet!

<b>Crunchy</b>: Well, you guys asked me to paint a picture.

<b>Chocoberry</b>: Just tell us what you hear!

<b>Crunchy</b>: I can't hear anything. They must be just lightly brushing their lips together.

<b>Starchie</b>: Or... maybe they kissed so much they passed out! Crunchy, open that door!

[<i>Crunchy tries to open the door but is too short to reach the knob.</i>]

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>: Step aside, Crunchy. I'll make short work of this door opening. [<i>crushes knob</i>] Oh. I guess I'm just too strong. [<i>flexes and winks</i>]

<b>Gumdrop Lass 1</b>: [<i>gasps</i>] Then they're trapped! What if they ran out of air?

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>: No air? I'll smash down the door!

<b>Chet</b>: Stop!

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>: Huh?

<b>Chet</b>: Mr. Cupcake, your mighty strength might kill them! There's a drill and saw in the supply room, though.

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>: In here, you say? [<i>walks to another door</i>]

<b>Candy People</b>: No, don't!

[<i>Mr. Cupcake crushes the knob on the door to the supply closet.</i>]

<b>Candy People</b>: Aw...

[<i>Mr. Cupcake flexes and winks again.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></b>: Yo, guys! You gotta do something! That's my best friend in there! [<i>texts on his phone</i>] "You okay in there?"

[<i>Finn and Princess Bubblegum are walking outside.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>texting</i>] Yeah, we went out the secret coat passage.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: It's so nice to get away sometimes.

[<i>Some horses wave to them.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm. Candy peeps can be a handful, huh? [<i>waves to horses</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Yeah. They mean well, though. You wanna meet <a href="/wiki/Timmy" title="Timmy">Timmy</a>?

[<i>Princess Bubblegum stops the treadmill, and they both take off their virtual reality headsets.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>high-pitched</i>] Timmy!

[<i>Timmy walks up to them. Princess Bubblegum hugs it.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Aw! So squish!

[<i>Princess Bubblegum climbs on to the oversize cat.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Hop on!

<b>Finn</b>: Okay. [<i>hops on</i>]

[<i>Timmy jumps up some ledges and takes them into a passage. The scene cuts back to the candy foyer, where Mr. Cupcake is forcing air through a tube leading under the door to the closet.</i>]

<b>Candy People</b>: Breathe!

[<i>Mr. Cupcake breathes into the tube.</i>]

<b>Candy People</b>: Breathe!

[<i>Mr. Cupcake breathes.</i>]

<b>Candy People</b>: Breathe!

<b>Chet</b>: Wait. Wait! Don't Candy People breathe out, like, poisonous gas or something? Something like... [<i>stammering</i>] carbo... carrin dio—

<b>Jake</b>: I know! It's called... [<i>farts into pillow</i>] And it is deadly.

<b>Candy People</b>: [<i>screaming</i>]

<b>Chocoberry</b>: Suck it back out! Suck it back out!

[<i>Mr. Cupcake tries sucking the tube but faints.</i>]

<b>Candy People</b>: [<i>screaming</i>]

<b>Chet</b>: Cupcake's dead! What do we do?!

<b>Jake</b>: Ha-a. [<i>eats chips</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: So got any other weekend plans?

<b>Finn</b>: Mmm... probably gonna hit up the arts and crafts kingdom with <a href="/wiki/BMO" title="BMO">BMO</a>. You?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh, I'm gonna garden some, plan next week's pizza lunch, answer 800 e-mails, and... you know, whatever.

[<i>They reach a tree with glowing fruit.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Wows. Do you ever get tired from doing princess work all the time?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Sure. I mean, it's a lot of responsibility [<i>picks a fruit</i>] looking after so many people, though lately I have been trying to be more chill about it. [<i>pulls seeds out of fruit and showers Finn with them</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Cool, like taking ice cream breaks?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Yeah, and, like, being more... sorta okay with everyone making mistakes around me. Like "mind my own stuff" more. You know what I mean?

[<i>Several candy birds land on Finn and peck at the seeds.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah. Kind of like how I've been thinking about my dad and how I want him to act more like daddy. But, but maybe acting like daddy just isn't what he does. Maybe my dad's not a dad but a kid stuck in a dad's body.

[<i>Timmy suddenly pounces on Finn.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>gasps</i>]

[<i>Timmy licks Finn's face.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Timmy knows what's up!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Timmy!

<b>Finn &amp; Princess Bubblegum</b>: Timmy!

[<i>Finn takes a selfie of the three of them together. The scene then cuts back to the Candy Kingdom.</i>]

<b>Manfried</b>: Okey-dokey, everybody! Check it out!

[<i>The Gumdrop Lasses are knitting a giant sweater.</i>]

<b>Manfried</b>: Once in place, this sweater will muffle the cannonball explosion perfectly, allowing the frame around the door to gently fall apart, freeing Finn and PB.

[<i>The Candy People applaud.</i>]

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>: Manfried's a good leader because we can always see him.

<b>Manfried</b>: Now the cannon should go right over here. [<i>spins around</i>] Oh, wait. Here. [<i>points with foot</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>]

<b>Chocoberry</b>: Aren't you worried about Finn?

<b>Jake</b>: Of course I am! See these tears of worry? [<i>produces fake tears</i>]

<b>Chocoberry</b>: [<i>pats his arm</i>] It will be okay, Jake.

[<i>Chocoberry runs off. Jake laughs at a video Finn sent him and views a text from Finn.</i>]

<b>Finn (voiceover)</b>: PB is showing me all this cool stuff. She has an awesome shirt. How's the party?

[<i>Jake looks up to see <a href="/wiki/Colonel_Candy_Corn" title="Colonel Candy Corn">Colonel Candy Corn</a> preparing the cannon. He texts back "Awesome."</i>]

<b>Manfried</b>: Okay, everyone, prepare for the boom.

[<i>The Candy People cover their ears.</i>]

<b>Manfried</b>: Three... two...

<b>Colonel Candy Corn</b>: Fire!

[<i>Colonel Candy Corn fires the cannon, which explodes, leaving a crater and exposing broken pipes.</i>]

[<i>The Candy People gasp.</i>]

<b>Colonel Candy Corn</b>: Aw, my cannon.

<b>Manfried</b>: Uh-oh.

<b><a href="/wiki/Banana_Guard" title="Banana Guard" class="mw-redirect">Banana Guard</a></b>: Hey, the closet's open!

[<i>The Candy People scream.</i>]

<b>Crunchy</b>: So they're dead, right?

<b><a href="/wiki/Ice_Cream_Guy" title="Ice Cream Guy">Ice Cream Guy</a></b>: Chocoberry can tell us! She saw a ghost at my house once.

<b>Chocoberry</b>: <i>Oui</i>, it's true. I have the gift. [<i>walks into closet, eyes closed</i>] Yes. I sense their spirits.

[<i>The Candy People gasp.</i>]

<b>Chocoberry</b>: Finn says... He says, "Remember to feed BMO." [<i>gasps, cries</i>]

[<i>The Candy People cry.</i>]

<b>Colonel Candy Corn</b>: That idea stank, Manfried! I'm calling the shots from now on.

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>: No! Manfried is still the most clearly visible.

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, why don't you guys team up and fight each other to see who gets to wear the crown. [<i>points to painting of Princess Bubblegum</i>]

[<i>The Candy People split up and form teams. Both sides growl and shake their fists at the other.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>]

[<i>Crunchy is seen hiding in the shadows.</i>]

<b>Crunchy</b>: [<i>laughs menacingly</i>]

[<i>The scene cuts back to Finn and Princess Bubblegum. Princess Bubblegum hums while she prepares a concoction made using tiny Candy People. It ignites with a blue, green, and yellow flame. She offers it to Finn.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Here, try this one.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>takes a sip</i>] Mmm... fire.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] You got a little edible fire mustache there.

<b>Finn</b>: What? [<i>views himself on his phone's camera and laughs</i>] Gonna send this to Jake. [<i>takes a picture</i>]

[<i>Jake sends Finn a video.</i>]

<b>Jake (voiceover)</b>: Check it out.

[<i>Finn plays the video. It shows two Banana Guards hitting Manfried with baseball bats, Mr. Cupcake throwing Chocoberry across the room at Colonel Candy Corn, and <a href="/wiki/Gumdrop_Lass_2" title="Gumdrop Lass 2">Gumdrop Lass 2</a> chasing Starchie around the pit.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Hey, what's that?

<b>Finn</b>: Uh, it's—

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Let me see.

<b>Finn</b>: Mm. You won't like it, but okay. [<i>hands her his phone</i>]

[<i>Princess Bubblegum watches the video. She groans.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I'll worry about it later.

<b>Finn</b>: Oh.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: You wanna see the burrito room?

<b>Finn</b>: Yuss!

[<i>Back in the Candy Kingdom, Colonel Candy Corn is wearing the crown torn from the picture of Princess Bubblegum.</i>]

<b>Colonel Candy Corn</b>: This is a brutal new society. For a society to function, it needs rules. 1. You must drink tea with your pizza. 2. Pizza can only be eaten alone. 3. If a pizza is found in a field, you must make the next person you see holding a glass of milk eat it.

<b>Crunchy</b>: Sire, I must congratulate you on becoming princess.

<b>Colonel Candy Corn</b>: Thank you.

<b>Crunchy</b>: Is there anything I can do or get for you?

<b>Colonel Candy Corn</b>: Anything?

<b>Crunchy</b>: Anything.

<b>Colonel Candy Corn</b>: Could you perhaps procure a pizza?

<b>Crunchy</b>: [<i>darkly</i>] Yes. [<i>walks backwards</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Man, this is intense. I better do something! [<i>takes a bunch of selfies</i>]

[<i>Finn and Princess Bubblegum are sitting on the treadmill and watching the fake sunset.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Thanks for showing me around, PB. I've enjoyed just, just hanging out.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Me, too!

[<i>Finn gets Jake's pictures.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Jake just sent me a funny picture of himself. [<i>hands phone to Princess Bubblegum</i>]

[<i>Princess Bubblegum flips through them and laughs, pausing when she sees Colonel Candy Corn wielding an axe in the background of one.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Whoa. It looks like the Candy People's makeshift government has been taken over by a ruthless despot.

<b>Finn</b>: What? Why aren't you freaking out?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Eh, it was worth giving them a shot. Let's go back to the party, though. It looks like we have to save it.

[<i>In the candy foyer, a giant statue of Crunchy stands over the crater formed from the cannon's explosion. Crunchy, wearing the painted crown, is riding Colonel Candy Corn like a horse.</i>]

<b>Colonel Candy Corn</b>: Neigh! Whinny!

<b>Candy People</b>: [<i>chanting</i>] Crunchy! Crunchy! Crunchy!

<b>Crunchy</b>: To the crater!

[<i>The Candy People walk to the crater. Dr. Donut and Ice Cream Guy are holding Starchie on the ledge.</i>]

<b>Crunchy</b>: Any last words, Starchie?

<b>Starchie</b>: You smell.

<b>Crunchy</b>: Throw him in!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: What's going on here?

<b>Candy People</b>: Uh...

<b>Jake</b>: They devolved into beasts. It has hilarious.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Okay, everybody get into your sleeping bags, and I'll read you a story.

[<i>The Candy People, gathered around Princess Bubblegum in their sleeping bags, wait for Princess Bubblegum to start reading.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>clears throat</i>] Modern menswear can be traced back two hundred years. Furs and textiles became easier to produce...

[<i>Finn flips through the pictures he took earlier on his phone. He lightly laughs at one of him and Princess Bubblegum puffing their cheeks out.</i>]
