<b>Person</b>:  Yeah, right!

<b>Jake</b>:  Whatever!

<b>Sir Slicer</b>:  Be quiet! I -- I am more Click-click than all of you!

<b>Finn</b>:  Come over here and say that to my fist!

<b>Sir Slicer</b>:  Okay, I will! [<i>Gets down from his horse, falls down and lands on side</i>] Whoa! Er... Ugh, this armor's too heavy! Ah, no problem. I'll just prop myself up on this stick. [<i>Grabs a stick</i>] Aghhh! Splinter!
