[<i>The episode begins in the <a href="/wiki/Ice_Kingdom" title="Ice Kingdom">Ice Kingdom</a>.</i>]

<a href="/wiki/Ice_King" title="Ice King"><b>Ice King</b></a>: [<i>Off-screen</i>] Okay, <a href="/wiki/Gunter" title="Gunter">Gunter</a>! You ready for the show to begin?!

<b>Gunter</b>:  Wenk! [<i>Sips drink</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  One, two, three... [<i>He comes out, revealing he's wearing a <a href="/wiki/Marceline" title="Marceline">Marceline</a> wig.</i>] [<i>Singing</i>] Gunter! [<i>Sings the <a href="/wiki/Fry_Song#Ice_King.27s_.22Gunter.22_version" title="Fry Song">Gunter version of the Fry song</a></i>] [<i>Gunter stares lovingly at Ice King.</i>] [<i>Speaking</i>] It's rhetorical, Gunter. Marceline's songs are so good! Mmm... Maybe I can get Marceline to write a song <i>with</i> me! [<i>The penguin pulls off Ice King's wig.</i>] Man, if she helped me write a song like that, I'd be crushin' it nonstop with the princesses! Ooh, yeah! [<i>The Ice King notices that the penguin is chewing on the wig.</i>] Heh! Gunter, you cute little dummy. You know, Gunter, my song is gonna need some dope lyrics to lure the honeys in. Hmm.

[<i>Walks to a bookshelf and pulls out a book</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  <a href="/wiki/Jay_T._Doggzone" title="Jay T. Doggzone">Jay T. Doggzone</a> always says, "Ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts." And I've got a <a href="/wiki/Ice_King#Origin" title="Ice King"><i>way</i> tortured past</a>! ...I think. I don't really... re... [<i>Unsure</i>] Hmm. [<i>Flies up and grabs the penguin</i>] Quickly, Gunter! To the "The Past" room!

[<i>Carrying the penguin, he flies down to the depths of his lair and arrives in a room full of various items.</i>] Ah, yes. [<i>He opens a drawer and takes out his scrapbook.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Lot of emotional, powerful stuff in here. [<i>Sniffs it</i>] Still wet with tears... I'll take some-a' these for lyrical inspiration. [<i>Throws scrapbook on pile of junk</i>] So where's Marceline <i>living</i> these days?

<b>Penguin</b>:  Wenk.

<b>Ice King</b>:  A <a href="/wiki/Marceline%27s_cave" title="Marceline's cave"><i>cave</i></a>?? [<i>Blows a small raspberry</i>]

[<i>Ice King flies out of his lair, carrying the penguin, an Omnichord, and a drumset. He's being viewed through binoculars.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>:  [<i>Viewing Ice King</i>] Well, well, well. Looks like the Ice King is up to bad biscuits, brotha.

<b><a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></b>:  Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro.

<b>Finn</b>:  Ice King, you make our job too easy. You ready to roll on this fool?

<b>Jake</b>:  <i>Dinner</i> roll!

[<i>Scene transition to Marceline's cave. Marceline is strumming her <a href="/wiki/Ax_bass" title="Ax bass" class="mw-redirect">ax bass</a>. She notices Ice King coming in the cave through her window.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Hello? Anybody home?

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>To herself</i>] No... [<i>She goes outside her <a href="/wiki/Marceline%27s_house" title="Marceline's house">house</a>.</i>] What are you <i>doing</i> here? I told you <i>not</i> to come around me!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] Uh, yeah, I know, but... I was hoping you could help me write a song—one that could help me get some princess action.

<b>Marceline</b>:  I'm not gonna help you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/profanity" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:profanity">pick up on chicks!</a>

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Desperate</i>] Come on! We could be a prog rock duo! I'll even split the fans with you. I get the princesses, and you get... whatever it is you're into. Sounds good, yeah, I think it does! [<i>Beat; Marceline is scowling.</i>] Ee-yoop!

[<i>He laughs as he flies into her house. Marceline waves Gunter goodbye and follows Ice King. Gunter looks down in disappointment and walks away.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>Landing on porch; to Ice King</i>] Hey!!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Eh...

<b>Marceline</b>:  Get <i>outta</i> here!!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Wait! Just let me play you what I've written so far! [<i>He unties his equipment and it falls to the ground.</i>] [<i>To himself</i>] Oh. Dang it. Tangles in the cord. Sometimes this happens when you fly with it... Tangles are hard... [<i>He grunts as he tries to untangle it. Marceline just stares.</i>] Oh. Aw, aw, geez, no... Oh, no. [<i>He lays on the ground, trapped in the tangled cord.</i>] Ice King's in trouble. [<i>She looks at him awkwardly.</i>] [<i>Grunts</i>] [<i>To Marceline</i>] Hey, you know what? I'll just hum it for ya. [<i>Hums a tune</i>] Is that good?

[<i>The door opens.</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  Ice King!

<b>Finn</b>:  ...Wha?

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh... You got 'im.

<b>Finn</b>:  Nice job, Marceline.

[<i>Jake walks up to Ice King.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Talking like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Batman">Batman</a></i>] Your constant harassment of the female gender makes me sick.

[<i>Jake picks up Ice King. He and Finn start to walk off with him.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  No, he can stay.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  Wha?!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yeah, "Wha?!"

<b>Marceline</b>:  It's alright. We're working on a song together. [<i>She takes Ice King.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  You don't want us to... [<i>Connects palm with fist</i>] ...for you?

<b>Marceline</b>:  No, it's okay. You guys can go.

[<i>Finn and Jake begin to exit, confused.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  ...Okay... Well... I guess we'll see ya, then...

[<i>They look around awkwardly.</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  Bye... [<i>They exit.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>To Marceline</i>] You know, I kinda like bein' tied up in these cords. Kinda <i>freak-aaaayyy</i>!

[<i>She immediately drops him.</i>]

[<i>Scene transition. Marceline plugs in and turns on the Omnichord.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  So what kinda song're we playing?

<b>Ice King</b>:  Ooh. I brought these [<i>the scrapbook pages</i>] for some inspiration. Just use these to work off of. Y'know, a template.

[<i>She grabs a page. It's drenched in tears.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  Oookaaaay...

[<i>She plays the Omnichord.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yeah. Yeah, that's good! Keep doin' that! [<i>Ice King snaps to the music.</i>] [<i>Singing</i>] <a href="/wiki/Slime_Princess" title="Slime Princess">Slime Princess</a>, you're alright. <a href="/wiki/Flame_Princess" title="Flame Princess">Flame Princess</a>, you're okay. <a href="/wiki/Wildberry_Princess" title="Wildberry Princess">Wildberry Princess</a> could be better. All of the <a href="/wiki/Princess_(disambiguation)" title="Princess (disambiguation)">princesses</a> are pretty alright, but... Oh, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Bubblegum</a>! You look like a lot of fun! I'm right outside, and that is how I know! Hey, princess, did you get my text with a picture of my awesome gun show? I'm also workin' on my pecs! If you like, I'll send a picture of that, too! Oh, Bubblegum! [<i>Marceline looks uncomfortable.</i>] I really need someone. [<i>She sadly looks down.</i>] Or anyone! [<i>Saddening</i>] ...Pretty much anyone. I'm so alone! [<i>Activating <a href="/wiki/Ice_Powers" title="Ice Powers" class="mw-redirect">ice magic</a></i>] Won't somebody tell me what's wrong with me?! [<i>Shooting frozen lightning bolts</i>] Anybody! [<i>Tearing up</i>] Anybody! [<i>Marceline turns at the sound of his distress.</i>] [<i>Speaking</i>] Anybody!!! [<i>Practically sobbing</i>] <a href="/wiki/Grob_Gob_Glob_Grod" title="Grob Gob Glob Grod">Grod</a> in the sky, please tell me why!!!

<b>Marceline</b>:  Stop acting like this!!

<b>Ice King</b>:  No, it's just startin' to get good!! [<i>Shooting ice beams everywhere, singing</i>] Anybody!! [<i>Speaking</i>] Princesses, I command you, <i>love</i> me!! Love me!! Love me!! [<i>Crying</i>] Love me!!

[<i>She forces him to the ground.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>Direct</i>] STOP ACTING CRAZY.

<b>Ice King</b>:  I JUST WANNA BE LOVED!! [<i>Pushes her off forcefully</i>] Uh-oh. I'm sorry I pushed you. [<i>He goes to the kitchen and plants his head against the refrigerator in sadness.</i>] Uh... oh... I'll just stay out of your way. [<i>Climbs on refrigerator</i>] Again, I'm sorry I pushed you.

[<i>Marceline walks to the refrigerator and sighs. She then opens it and takes out an apple. Ice King's beard lightly rubs her head.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  Huh?

<b>Ice King</b>:  Whatcha got? An apple?

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>Frustrated</i>] Ugh! [<i>She drops the apple and just drops down, sitting in front of the fridge. She rolls the apple away; the apple reaches the Omnichord and turns it on.</i>] [<i>Singing</i>] You're so annoying, you <i>pitiful</i> old man. I'd like to help you, but I don't know if I can. I thought you were nuts, but you're <i>really really really</i> nuts. [<i>Beat</i>] Every time I move, eventually, you find me, and start hanging around. Just another lame excuse to see me. <i>Man</i>. It's getting me <i>down</i>. You know, I'm actually glad... to see you! [<i>Speaking</i>] Maybe <i>I'm</i> the one who's... [<i>Sighing</i>] nuts.

[<i>The Omnichord switches off.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Hold on! [<i>Drops from fridge</i>] Do you... <i>like</i> me?!

<b>Marceline</b>:  ...Of <i>course</i> I do, you old jerk!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Really? ...Wow. [<i>Wipes dirt off sleeve</i>] How about... [<i>Spreading arms out</i>] one of these? [<i>Marceline's scowl fades. She consents and hugs him, visibly bittersweet about it.</i>] Ah! [<i>They pull back and look at each other in the eyes. He puckers his lips.</i>] Mwah, mwah, mwah...

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>Disgusted</i>] AAAAAGH!!! <i>Not</i> like <i>that</i>!! You don't remember anything, <i>do</i> you... SIMON?

<b>Ice King</b>:  What-mon?

<b>Marceline</b>:  Why do you even come <i>see</i> me when you don't <i>remember</i> me?! You don't even know who <i>you</i> are!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yes, I do! I am a lyricist! [<i>Pulling pages out</i>] It's all here! On the page! The page in song, baby! On this receipt! On this takeout menu! On these newspapers! [<i>Laughs</i>]

[<i>Marceline stares, devastated. A photo lands in her hands.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  Huh? Look! This clipping! This was <i>you</i>, Simon! <i>Before</i> the <a href="/wiki/Mushroom_War" title="Mushroom War">War</a>!

[<i>The picture portrays a human Ice King walking out of a car ready to deliver <a href="/wiki/The_Enchiridion_(book)" title="The Enchiridion (book)">the Enchiridion</a> to a museum.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Huh? [<i>He can't make heads or tails of it.</i>] Heh?

[<i>Marceline hurries to look for something else. She finds a picture of herself as a child and gasps.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  This! <i>You</i> took this <i>picture</i>! Grr, you've scribbled all over it... Huh? [<i>She reads the back of the photo, visibly in great shock.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Ooh, ooh, are they good lyrics? [<i>Grabbing Omnichord</i>] I'll get the keyboard!

<b>Marceline</b>:  What? [<i>In desperation</i>] Wait, listen!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Sets Omnichord up</i>] Yeah, let's go! What's it say? Sing out, sister!

[<i>Marceline reads the message again, then stares at Ice King, not sure what to do.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>Singing and reading note</i>] "Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world? That must be so confusing for a little girl. And I know you're going to need me here with you... but I'm losing myself, and I'm afraid you're going to lose me, too..."

<b>Ice King</b>:  Ooh, yeah! Keep it going! [<i>Goes to drumset</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>Looking for another photo</i>] Oh! Um... [<i>Singing and reading note</i>] "This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me [<i>Pulling hair back, stressed out</i>] crazy, and I need to save you, but who's going to save me? Please forgive me for whatever I do [<i>Marceline shrinks in devastation</i>] ...when I don't remember you."

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Happy</i>] Wow! I wrote that?! Hot stuff!

<b>Marceline</b>:  What?! You don't remember what it <i>means</i>?! [<i>She grabs another photo and shows it to him. She tears up as her voice breaks.</i>] Look!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Reads note while singing</i>] "Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away. I can't remember what it made me say... but I remember that I saw you frown. I swear, it <i>wasn't</i> me. It was the <a href="/wiki/Ice_King%27s_crown" title="Ice King's crown">crown</a>. [<i>He frowns and looks confused, but then ignores it.</i>] This magic keeps me—"

<b>Ice King &amp; Marceline</b>:  [<i>Singing together</i>] "—alive, but it's making me crazy, [<i>Marceline begins shedding tears.</i>] and I want to save you, but who's going to save me?! Please forgive me for..."

[<i>Finn and Jake are still in the cave. Finn is looking in the house with his binoculars.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  What is goin' <i>on</i> in there?!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Takes binoculars off</i>] ...I have no idea.

<b>Ice King &amp; Marceline</b>:  [<i>Singing together</i>] "...Please forgive me for whatever I do... when I don't remember you."

[<i>As the music continues [and Ice King and Marceline sing, "Da da... da da... da da..."], the scene flashes back to just after the apocalypse. It looks dismal and there are ruined buildings everywhere. A child Marceline cries. Simon Petrikov returns to her and wipes her tears in recompense for leaving her alone. He walks to a ruined store and grabs a <a href="/wiki/Hambo" title="Hambo">teddy bear</a>. He goes back and gives the toy to Marceline to make further amends, and she smiles sweetly. The episode ends.</i>]
