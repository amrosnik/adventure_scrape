<b>Finn and Jake [<i>In unison</i>]</b>:  Yeeeaaah!

<b>Finn</b>:  What's for B-fast, Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  <a href="/wiki/Everything_burrito" title="Everything burrito" class="mw-redirect">Everything burrito</a>! [<i>Finn gasps and Jake begins wrapping the burrito.</i>] [<i>Whispering</i>] I love you, everything burrito. [<i>He kisses the burrito. Suddenly, there's a loud noise and the room momentarily quakes. Finn and Jake go downstairs to investigate.</i>] Oh, man. I think someone wants to eat everything burrito! I won't let 'em get ya, baby! [<i>Kisses the burrito once more</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake! Come on! Get ready!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Sets the burrito down</i>] Ready!

<b>Finn and Jake [<i>In unison</i>]</b>:  Yaaaaah!

[<i>Finn and Jake leap outside and discover the <a href="/wiki/Cuties" title="Cuties">Cuties</a>.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Cute_King" title="Cute King">Cute King</a></b>:  Peep!

<b>Jake</b>:  So cute!

<b>Finn</b>:  Look at their little faces! Haha!

<b>Jake</b>:  Haha!

<b>Cute King</b>:  We're not cute! We're evil, ...and we're here to dominate <i>you</i>!

<b>Finn</b>:  Get the camera, Jake!

<b>Jake</b>:  I can't! I'm paralyzed by the cuteness!

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  <a href="/wiki/BMO" title="BMO">BMO</a>! BMO! BMO! BMO!

[<i>BMO enters and pushes Finn and Jake aside.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>:  What? What? What? What?

<b>Finn and Jake [<i>In unison</i>]</b>:  BMO! Get the camera!

<b>BMO</b>:  BMO <i>is</i> camera!

[<i>Finn and Jake begin taking pictures with the Cuties, and Cute King gets increasingly annoyed.</i>]

<b>Cute King</b>:  Enough! Now... bow down to me, Cute King, and my legion of Cuties!

[<i>BMO takes another picture.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Great shot, BMO!

<b>Cute King</b>:  Since you won't take us seriously, we will kill you. Until then, enjoy your burrito, Jake.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Suddenly worried</i>] Huh?

[<i>Cute King chuckles and the Cuties walk away. Jake, inside the fort, gasps, and Finn and BMO run next to the door.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  My burrito!

<b>Finn</b>:  It's perfectly fine.

<b>Jake</b>:  No, Finn... They probably <i>poisoned</i> it!

<b>Finn</b>:  Naaaaawww...

<b>Jake</b>:  They knew my name. They knew about the burrito.

<b>Finn</b>:  Man, you're letting your brain dial turn your fear volume up. You'll see. Those Cuties are nothing but an afternoon's delight.

[<i>Scene switches to nighttime. Finn looks at Jake out the window. Jake is holding a shovel and standing next to his burrito's grave. Finn walks to his bed and yawns; he gets under the covers. Suddenly, Jake enters.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake? What're you doing in my bed?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>somewhat worried</i>] Oh, nothing much. You know, just... chillin'.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait a second... Are you still messed up about those little guys?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Beat</i>] A little.

<b>Finn</b>:  Look, man, whaddaya say tomorrow morning we go track those little guys down and find out just what their deal is? Sound good, buddy?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah. Thanks, buddy. [<i>Finn rests. Jake thinks for a moment.</i>] Man, you sound just like <a href="/wiki/Margaret" title="Margaret">Mom</a> sometimes.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah. Good ol' Mom.

<b>Jake</b>:  She always knew just what to say.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah. Goodnight, brudda.

<b>Jake</b>:  Goodnight. [<i>Fade to black. Suddenly, Jake whispers to Finn in a worried tone.</i>] Finn! Finn! [<i>We see Finn's point of view as he opens his eyes.</i>] Finn, wake up, man!

<b>Finn</b>:  Wha? Huh?

<b>Jake</b>:  I think someone's in the house. [<i>Finn makes a tired groaning noise as he lights a candle.</i>] For real, man! Shh, listen.

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh...

<b>Jake</b>:  I swear, man! I really heard something. [<i>Footsteps are heard, and Jake gasps.</i>] Finn!!

<b>Finn</b>:  I heard. [<i>Raising his voice</i>] Okay. Who's out there?

[<i>Finn shines the candle across the room and eventually spots two Cuties carrying <a href="/wiki/Jake%27s_sword" title="Jake's sword">Jake's sword</a>, who drop it and quickly crawl away.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  What theâ€”?! That's my sword! [<i>Picks it up</i>] What do they want with my sword, man?! [<i>Finn makes a worried face. There is a sudden noise downstairs.</i>] [<i>Whispering</i>] It came from downstairs.

<b>Finn</b>:  Alright. That's it.

<b>Jake</b>:  Where are you going?

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm gonna go man-handle those guys's banandles! [<i>Goes downstairs</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Beat</i>] ...What?! [<i>He follows.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Well, they broke a window, but I don't see any of 'em. [<i>Picks up a shard from the ground</i>] I guess they left. [<i>Throws it back down again</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, no. OH, AWWW, NO!

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, what is it?!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Drops his sword</i>] Awww, no! It's a dead goat, man! Its guts are all over the place! It's all chopped up and spread around and... [<i>Looks closer</i>] Ah, no, wait, it's just a blanket. I think I left it here this morning.

<b>Voice</b>:  Jaaaake! Fiiiinn! This is the voice of your moooom! I've come back to tell you how dumb you always aaaare! [<i>Voice is revealed to belong to a Cutie</i>] I hate you guys so muuuuch!

<b>Finn</b>:  Get 'im, Jake!

<b>Jake</b>:  Aaah! Aaah!

[<i>The Cutie hisses, making Jake shrink back in terror. Finn chases the Cutie, and it hides in a knothole; Finn grabs it and it starts struggling.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, I got 'im! He's freakin' out, man! What do I do?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Shake 'im!

<b>Finn</b>:  What?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Shake 'im around 'til he stops!

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay. [<i>He does so.</i>] Rrrrrrr! [<i>The Cutie gets tired out.</i>] They stopped.

<b>Jake</b>:  Okay. Now tell 'im not to talk about our mom!

<b>Finn</b>:  How do you even know our mom?

<b>Cutie's first head</b>:  We've been watching you.

<b>Cutie's second head</b>:  Learning your weaknesses.

<b>Finn</b>:  What?! Why?!

<b>Cutie's first head</b>:  For tomorrow morning.

<b>Cutie's second head</b>:  When our army comes and kills you both.

<b>Cutie's first head</b>:  You think we're so cute, when actually... we're the opposite of that!! [<i>Bites Finn's hand</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hold 'im!

[<i>Finn tries to keep a grip on the Cutie, but its arm is accidentally yanked off, allowing it to escape with a cackling laugh. Finn holds up the dismembered appendage.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, gross. [<i>tosses it away</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Well?! Do you believe me <i>now</i>, Finn?!

<b>Finn</b>:  I... I don't know <i>what</i> to believe anymore.

<b>Jake</b>:  Well, that's close enough. Let's start settin' up some barricades!

[<i>Scene switches to the following day. Finn and Jake are sitting behind their barricade holding weapons. Finn is asleep and Jake is anxiously waiting. Suddenly, a bugle in E is heard, and Finn wakes up with a start, accidentally firing an arrow from his <a href="/wiki/Finn%27s_crossbows" title="Finn's crossbows">crossbow</a>. Finn and Jake look out the window to find the cuties charging forward.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  There's gotta be a <i>thousand</i> of 'em!

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait. Jake, look.

[<i>The Cuties begin tripping over themselves, falling apart, and exploding (among other things) until there are none left.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Not scared anymore</i>] These guys aren't a threat to <i>anyone</i>.

<b>Finn</b>:  These guys are a threat to <i>themselves</i>.

[<i>One Cutie accidentally harms another, and Finn and Jake wince.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, hey, it's what's-his-face!

<b>Cute King</b>:  No... My men! Quickly, men! Pick yourselves up before the enemy sees! [<i>Finn and Jake look at each other.</i>] Come on, now. That's it. Easy does it. [<i>Cute King takes his injured soldiers away and Finn and Jake sneak after them.</i>] Bravest warriors! I ask you: must we have our butts handed to us by everyone we meet?! How will we <i>ever</i> splash around in the brains of our enemies if you guys can't take two steps without exploding?! <a href="/wiki/Bliblob" title="Bliblob">Bliblob</a>, I'm lookin' at you! [<i>Bliblob explodes.</i>] Can I <i>please</i> just get <i>one</i> victory?! ONCE?! [<i>The Cuties begin to cry.</i>] Now don't start that. [<i>Saddened</i>] Don't you do it! [<i>The Cuties burst into tears. Cute King tries to contain himself before joining them.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Wanna just smash 'em all?

<b>Finn</b>:  What?! No, man, look. These guys aren't gonna quit until they win or die, ...and they're <i>not</i> gonna win, so what if we <i>let</i> 'em win, just this once?

<b>Jake</b>:  What?! And mess up my stats?!

<b>Finn</b>:  No. We'd be winning by helping <i>them</i> to win. That's a win! [<i>Jake scowls at Finn's logic.</i>] And then they'll be happy and leave us alone.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Reluctantly</i>] Alright.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yessss! Now, let's rally an army so we can look intimidating.

<b>Jake</b>:  Who're we gonna call?

<b>Finn</b>:  All of our friends.

[<i>Scene switches to the "battlefield." Jake, <a href="/wiki/Lumpy_Space_Princess" title="Lumpy Space Princess">Lumpy Space Princess</a>, <a href="/wiki/Birds#Duck_in_Conquest_of_Cuteness" title="Birds">a duck</a>, BMO, and <a href="/wiki/Cinnamon_Bun" title="Cinnamon Bun">Cinnamon Bun</a> are all lined up in front of Finn.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  My army of friends! Today, we will lose this battle, but we will also win it! [<i>They cheer.</i>] When the enemy charges, crumble like a cookie. When you feel their puny punches, fade like a flower, and writhe in your own blood!

<b>BMO</b>:  But, but... how are we to bleed if none of this is real?

<b>Finn</b>:  With faith, m'lady... and ketchup!

[<i>They cheer again.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Ketchup is delicious and deceiving!

<b>Finn</b>:  And hey, guys... Let's keep the acting subtle. Less is more.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  No way. First, I'm gonna fall in love with one of those little guys, and then I'm gonna fall <i>out</i> of love, and then, I'm gonna totally fake-die of a fake heart attack! [<i>Acting</i>] "OH! MY HEART! MY HEART HURTS BECAUSE I FELL OUT OF LOVE! AND NOW I HAVE TO DIE! OOOOHHHHH!!!"

[<i>Bugle sounds again. The Cuties charge.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Get ready, y'all. Together, we <i>fall</i>!

[<i>Cinnamon Bun falls over.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Not yet, Cinnamon Bun!

[<i>Cute King charges in a giant suit of his men.</i>]

<b>Cute King</b>:  YAAAAH!

<b>Finn, Jake, Lumpy Space Princess, and BMO [<i>In unison</i>]</b>:  Whoa.

[<i>The suit is revealed to be incredibly small. The Cuties punch Finn.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, no! [<i>Squirts ketchup</i>] My blooood! [<i>Waves the bottle at the others, covering them in ketchup. The "battle" rages on.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Holding a Cutie</i>] One last kiss before dying, my love. [<i>Kisses the Cutie's face and throws the Cutie to the ground</i>] Farewell forever. Oh, oh, my heart! Waaah! [<i>Feigns death</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Falls over and feigns death</i>] I'm dead.

<b>Cute King</b>:  Victory... is... OURS! [<i>The Cuties cheer.</i>] Finally. I can do the victory dance! [<i>Starts dancing</i>] La! La-da! La-da-da la! La-da-da la da! [<i>Jake begins quietly snickering.</i>] La-la-da-la-la-la! [<i>Cute King notices Jake's snickering.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  BAAAHAHAHAHAHA! Ah, I'm sorry, everybody! Ah, I couldn't keep it in! Hahahaha!

<b>Cute King</b>:  No... [<i>Tastes the ketchup</i>] This is ketchup?!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Licks some off his fur</i>] Tastes better than blood. Or <i>does</i> it? Hey, Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup?

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake. Look. [<i>Points at Cute King, who is walking away and crying quietly.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Aw, nuts.

<b>Finn</b>:  Cute King, wait up.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Shrinks down to Cute King's size</i>] We wanna apologize for being fakers.

<b>Finn</b>:  We did it to protect you from yourselves.

<b>Cute King</b>:  It doesn't matter now. No one will <i>ever</i> fear our strength.

<b>Finn</b>:  But <i>strength</i> isn't your strength. Adorable cuteness is!

<b>Cute King</b>:  Can I use it to control others?

<b>Finn</b>:  Um... yeah, sure! Just be righteous about it.

<b>Cute King</b>:  Show me where to start.

[<i>Scene switches to the <a href="/wiki/Ice_Kingdom" title="Ice Kingdom">Ice Kingdom</a>. <a href="/wiki/Ice_King" title="Ice King">Ice King</a>, inside his lair, is just lying on his back making fart noises. A knock is heard.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Huh? Who could <i>that</i> be? [<i>Opens the door and looks down</i>]

<b>Cute King</b>:  I command you to make me a sandwich!

<b>Ice King</b>:  What?! No one commands the Ice King to make no sandwich!

<b>Cute King</b>:  [<i>Makes a cute pose</i>] What about <i>now</i>?

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Gasps then laughs</i>] Okay.

[<i>The episode ends with Ice King laughing playfully and Cute King laughing deviously before a camera flash ends the scene.</i>]
