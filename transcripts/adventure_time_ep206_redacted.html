[<i>In a forest, a group of vampires are playing instruments.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/The_Fool" title="The Fool">Fool</a></b>: Hey, this is nuts, right? [<i>floats over to <a href="/wiki/Vampire_King" title="Vampire King">Vampire King</a></i>] Look, I've got both my teeth. [<i>points</i>] Look! I lost one in a box turtle once. Also, I used to be dead.

[<i>The Vampire King grabs him and sucks his tooth out of his mouth.</i>]

<b>Vampire King</b>: Mwah! [<i>spits out tooth, which hits Fool in the eye</i>] Fool, this is <i>life</i>. Get a hot dog if you can't take the bun.

<b><a href="/wiki/The_Empress" title="The Empress">Empress</a></b>: Pah! It tastes different here. Where are we? It's like we fell asleep on a raft and woke up in strange seas.

<b><a href="/wiki/The_Hierophant" title="The Hierophant">Hierophant</a></b>: Hmph! "Fell asleep"? We died. The demon <a href="/wiki/Marceline" title="Marceline">Marceline</a> staked us all. Why are we back? How did it happen? Listen—I dunno and I don't care. We're alive and I'm going to get eating.

<b>Empress</b>: Ugh.

<b>Fool</b>: [<i>tries to put tooth back</i>] Ahhh... Does anyone have any milk for this? [<i>to <a href="/wiki/Cow_(Five_Short_Graybles)" title="Cow (Five Short Graybles)">cow</a></i>] Do you, like, carry milk?

<b>Cow</b>: Moo!

[<i>Vampire King places his hand on the cow's head.</i>]

<b>Cow</b>: Moo?

<b>Empress</b>: This is well and good for you, Hierophant, all you ever needed was a forest and something hot to chew on.

[<i>The Hierophant gnaws on his balalaika.</i>]

<b>Empress</b>: Where are the comforts of the old hive? The minions... the blood... the <i>good</i> blood with the gold leaf flaked into it.

<b>Vampire King</b>: The gold leaf was stupid. It didn't taste like anything.

<b>Empress</b>: We had standards! It doesn't matter when we are or where we are, because... we are. We must start rebuilding our realm. There's life here, and I bet it's pathetic.

[<i>The Vampire King starts dancing with the cow and humming.</i>]

<b>Empress</b>: We march in, we take control, and we rebuild the hive! My king, are you listening?

<b>Fool</b>: I dunno. Like... [<i>yawns</i>] What if we just got a loft downtown?

[<i>The Empress shoots a beam from the gem on her forehead at The Fool.</i>]

<b>Fool</b>: Whoops, I'm hypnotized. [<i>slaps himself</i>] Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh!

[<i>He falls on <a href="/wiki/The_Moon" title="The Moon">The Moon</a> headfirst, his hat damaging her head. She shakes him off, and her head regenerates.</i>]

<b>Fool</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Good old backwards egg!

<b>Cow</b>: Ugh. Ugh! I don't like to dance. I'm a wallflower.

[<i>Vampire King bites the cow.</i>]

<b>Cow</b>: Oh! Ugh.

<b>Hierophant</b>: My king, surely you agree that this is our chance to go back to our old ways. Surely diverging from the old ways is what made us vulnerable the first time. Surely—[<i>groans</i>]

[<i>Vampire King telepathically constricts The Hierophant and levitates him.</i>]

<b>Vampire King</b>: "Surely"?! Surely? Shirley J. Temple! [<i>releases Hierophant</i>]

<b>Hierophant</b>: Oh! [<i>lands with a thud</i>]

<b>Vampire King</b>: <i>I</i> am your king, and <i>I</i> say it's a new era! Old-fashioned ideas have no place here.

[<i>The Hierophant transforms into a boar.</i>]

<b>Hierophant</b>: [<i>growls</i>] Do what you like! I <i>know</i> what's right. [<i>runs off</i>]

<b>Empress</b>: If you're going to caterwaul like this, then I may as well start building my army. <i>Hasta luego</i>, turds. [<i>walks off and disappears</i>]

[<i>The Moon backs away into the forest, leaving a trail of bubbles. The Vampire King is still dancing with the cow, and The Fool is playing a drum.</i>]

<b>Cow</b>: Oh... gettin' dizzy...

[<i>A tiny <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a> emerges from underneath a leaf, terrified and gasping for breath. He runs off.</i>]
