<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>Both scream</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Oh. Heh heh. What? Where are we?

<b>Jake</b>: Mayhaps we drank juice of the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Toad" title="Elder Toad">Elder Toad</a>.

<b>Finn</b>: Eh, I doubt it. Yo, do you see this? We're in a cage! Do you think we, like, did something wrong?

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, right. When did we ever did wrong actions? Get real. [<i>takes out his cellphone</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Who ya calling?

<b>Jake</b>: I'm callin' BMO, see if he knows what happened. [<i>mutters</i>] Junk... My new <a href="/wiki/Jake%27s_phone#New_phone" title="Jake's phone">camera phone</a>... Wait, c'mere!

<b>Finn</b>: What?

<b>Jake</b>: I guess I vid-taped a buttload of stuff on here.

<b>Finn</b>: Play it for the clues within.

<b>Jake</b>: Okay, play. [<i>clicks play button on his phone</i>]

[<i>Static on phone</i>]

<b>Finn [<i>on phone</i>]</b>: Did you take it yet?

<b>Jake [<i>on phone</i>]</b>: Recording.

<b>Finn [<i>on phone</i>]</b>: Okay, get a shot of the portal.

[<i>Jake moves the phone to reveal a blue swirling vortex that is apparently a Nightosphere portal</i>]

<b>Finn [<i>on phone</i>]</b>: Gonna go through this biz!

<b>Jake [<i>on phone</i>]</b>: Alright, let's do—[<i>screen goes blank, video ends</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, no! What?!

<b>Jake</b>: Battery crunked out.

<b>Finn</b>: Dude, do you remember any of that mess?

<b>Jake</b>: No, but I guess we're here on purpose?

<b>Finn</b>: So we opened a portal to somewhere, but where? [<i>walks to the bars on the cage where a jailer demon is standing</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Demon_Guard" title="Demon Guard">Nightosphere Jailer</a></b>: The <a href="/wiki/Nightosphere_(location)" title="Nightosphere (location)">Nightosphere</a>.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>both scream</i>] AHHHhhhh...

<b>Nightosphere Jailer</b>: You're in the Nightosphere.

<b>Finn</b>: Are you sure?

<b>Nightosphere Jailer</b>: Uh, yes. You got thrown in jail. Look. [<i>flies up to a light switch and pushes it down, lighting up cages along the walls full of howling demons</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Look!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>gasps</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts to a shot of a statue of Marceline's father.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Marceline's dad! We really are in the Nightosphere!

<b>Nightosphere Jailer</b>: Up an' at em, people. [<i>opens cages</i>] Eveyone out of your cages. My shift is over, and no one's shown up, so...

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa, wait. You're letting us go?

<b>Nightosphere Jailer</b>: I mean... yeah, but not really. You're in the nightosphere, so...

<b>Finn</b>: So what?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>holds up cellphone and charger</i>] Is there an outlet somewhere for this?

<b>Nightosphere Jailer</b>: [<i>laughing loudly</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, c'mon! Just tell us how we can get back to our world.

<b>Nightosphere Jailer</b>: You can't leave the Nightosphere. Not unless <i>he</i> let's you. [<i>points to statue</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: Marceline's dad.

<b>Nightosphere Jailer</b>: Yeah, that's <a href="/wiki/Hunson_Abadeer" title="Hunson Abadeer">Hunson Abadeer</a>. He runs this place.

[<i>Scene cuts to a plaque under the statue that says, "HUNSON ABADEER: OUR GREAT LEADER IS WITH US FOR ALL ETERNITY" and a large caterpillar-like demon runs between the statues legs.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hunson Abadeer? [<i>giggles</i>] Alright.

<b>Finn</b>: Well, dude, how do we talk to him?

<b>Nightosphere Jailer</b>: You can't just talk to the boss. You gotta make an appointment.

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, but we don't even know why we're here!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>holding up a banana</i>] And what's up with this?

<b>Nightosphere Jailer</b>: Ugh. Oh! Oh, oh, sick! You touched that stuff?!

[<i>Jake looks at the banana questioningly.</i>]

<b>Nightosphere Jailer</b>: Later, fools. [<i>goes away</i>]

[<i>Demons cheer.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>trying to get the demons' attention</i>] Hey! Hey! Is there an outlet anywhere? You guys...

<b>Finn</b>: Maybe this is where they put all the dummy demons. [<i>cuddles a caterpillar demon and talks to it in a baby-like voice</i>] Right, big guy? You're not so smart, right? Yeah... [<i>to Jake; normal voice</i>] Let's go out that hole, man.

<b>Jake</b>: Okay, get on.

[<i>Finn climbs on his back, and Jake stretches up through the hole. They climb out and see various scenes of chaos.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Pretty neat.

[<i>A reddish cloud flies overhead and obliterates a mountain with a green ray.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa, look!

[<i>Cloud shoots more rays.</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts to a demon kid playing with tiny demons.</i>]

<b>Demon dad</b>: [<i>to his kid</i>] Charlie, don't socialize with the smaller demons! They're dirty and stupid!

[<i>Ray strikes the dad, turning him into a bunch of little demons.</i>]

<b>Charlie</b>: Daddy!

[<i>Cloud shoots a mountain, turning it into a sculpture of Hunson Abadeer's head.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What is that?

<b>Jake</b>: I think it's like sentient blood mist.

<b>Finn</b>: Cool.

<b>Jake</b>: C'mon, let's see if anyone knows where Hunson Abadeer is.

<b>Finn</b>: Alright, well, how about that dude? [<i>points to a one-eyed pink demon which is cut open like a cross section so you can see his guts</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Okay.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>to the demon and the little demons traveling on him</i>] Yo, bros! How do we talk to Hunson Abadeer?

<b><a href="/wiki/Half_Monster_Demon" title="Half Monster Demon">Half Monster Demon</a></b>: [<i>telepathically</i>] The teller can help you. Get in my flipping belly, and I will transport you. My insides are habitable. You will not be digested.

[<i>Finn and Jake climb in, and the demon flies them over to a river full of little demons.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Bye, mister! [<i>Looks around</i>] Who's the teller? That guy? [<i>He looks toward a birdlike demon in a rowboat rowing on top of the little demons. The <a href="/wiki/Demons#Boat_Demon" title="Demons">Boat Demon</a> bangs one of the small ones with an oar.</i>]

<b>Boat Demon</b>: Okay, bozos, make room, make room, make room!

<b>Small Demon</b>: Ouch! Come on!

<b>Boat Demon</b>: Scooch over, fatty.

<b>Small Demon</b>: I can't, dude. This outbox is packed tighter than my tummy tunnel when I can't make brown on the camping trips because of my anxieties and I have IBS also. [<i>gets hit with oar</i>] Ow!

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, guy, are you the teller?

<b>Boat Demon</b>: No, no, no, this is the line to <i>meet</i> the teller.

<b>Finn</b>: No, man, are you for real? How long's the wait?!

<b>Boat Demon</b>: I dunno. I just like to row around on top of their heads.

<b>Finn</b>: Bunk that!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>holds up the banana</i>] Hey, do you know about this?

<b>Boat Demon</b>: I... ew, no. [<i>scoffs</i>] Sick.

<b>Finn</b>: Why do we need to see the teller anyway? We just wanna see Hunson Abadeer and find out what happened to us!

<b>Boat Demon</b>: The teller will get you in touch with Hunson Abadeer. We got systems down here. You gotta swim the proper channels, ya know?

<b>Small Demon</b>: Youse ain't special! Youse gotta wait just like the rest of youse... [<i>corrects himself</i>] Us.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Where's the line start?

<b>Boat Demon</b>: Oh... I dunno. The thing sorta governs itself.

[<i>Finn and Jake climb into the river and squeeze in between the demons.</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>grimace as they squeeze in</i>] Tight!

[<i>Boat Demon rows over their heads.</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: Ow!

[<i>Finn moans.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>looking at the boat demon</i>] That guy stinks.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>to a big demon</i>] Excuse me! Excuse me! Big man? Over here!

<b><a href="/wiki/Demons#Big_Demon" title="Demons">Big Demon</a></b>: Huh? What, me?

<b>Finn</b>: Uh, yeah, how long have you been in line for?

<b>Big Demon</b>: How... long? [<i>shudders and starts crying</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, butt traps. Jake, stretch us to the front.

<b>All demons</b>: NO CUTTING!!!

<b>Big Demon</b>: I will kill you with all my hopes and regrets!

<b>Finn</b>: All right, dudes, chill! We'll wait! [<i>whistles</i>]

[<i>Time card: TWO DAYS LATER</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: I can't feel my legs.

[<i>Time card: FOUR DAYS LATER</i>]

[<i>Finn and Jake are both quietly crying</i>]

[<i>Time card: EIGHT DAYS LATER</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: SAY SOMETHING!! Say something to me!!!

<b>Jake</b>: I... can't. I got nothing to say anymore.

<b>Finn</b>: Just make up words then!

<b>Jake</b>: Bloobity bloo bloo blah blee blee blah. Shree shrah...

[<i>Time card: THIRTEEN DAYS EIGHTEEN HOURS LATER</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, check it out. We're at the front of the line.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: Woohoo!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>to the teller</i>] Yo, yo! We wanna talk to Abadeer!

<b><a href="/wiki/Teller" title="Teller" class="mw-redirect">Teller</a></b>: Wha... Huh? [<i>hands Finn a slip of paper with a number on it</i>] When your thingy comes up, Hunson Abadeer will see you through the door.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>reading from paper</i>] 42 million?! What's the number on the door?

[<i>The door reads 41,999,999.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: 41 million... [<i>mutters gibberish</i>] We're next! Whew! Man, I thought I was gonna throw up!

[<i>The number changes to 42 million.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: That's us!

<b>Jake</b>: Yaaay! [<i>sees that there is another extremely long line</i>] Nooooooo!

<b>Finn</b>: I'm gonna lose it! Waaaaaaaaaaahhh... [<i>he continues screaming like this for quite some time</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, do you know if there's an outlet anywhere?

<b>Two-headed Demon</b>: No.

<b>Jake</b>: Do you know what this is all about? [<i>holds up banana</i>]

<b>Two-headed Demon</b>: No... gross.

[<i>Finn stops screaming and is lying face down on the ground, exhausted.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: What's going on, buddy? You givin' up?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] I guess.

<b>Jake</b>: You don't wanna just stick it out a little more?

<b>Finn</b>: I don't know if my little boy heart can take it.

<b>Jake</b>: Listen, Finn. Are you listening?

<b>Finn</b>: Mm-hmm.

<b>Jake</b>: Your heart may be small, but it's strong as a bull donk. And I know. You can wait through this line so we can meet Hunson Abadeer and find out why we're here, and why we're in a pile of banianials, 'cause you're a champ, OK?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>shrugs</i>] Ok.

<b>Jake</b>: 上手で頑張ってね ("Being that you are skilled you can do it!")

<b>Finn</b>: Well, at least I can see the end of the line, I think. Let's wait the heck out of this line!

<b>Jake</b>: That's it, champ. [<i>Finn starts to jog in place</i>] Hehehehe, you're pretty pumped up.

<b>Finn</b>: I'm super pumped!

<b>Cloud</b>: Does anyone need to go pee-pees?

[<i>One demon raises his hand.</i>]

<b>Cloud</b>: Go ahead.

[<i>The demon runs ahead of line.</i>]

Okay, who's here with a question for Mr. Abadeer?

[<i>Finn and Jake raise their hands.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, yeah, we've got questions.

[<i>The cloud destroys the demons who raised their hands.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>gasps</i>] Put your hand down, Finn!

<b>Finn</b>: No way, dude, I got questions.

[<i>Jake goes away with Finn.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What the hey, Jake!

<b>Jake</b>: It's not answering questions, man. That thing is gonna bake our beans.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>takes out his sword and goes on top of a rock</i>] Hey, bloodmist cloud! What happened to us? Why can't we remember any—? Oh, it's gone.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Points to cloud</i>] Look.

[<i>The cloud goes inside a cave</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Ride me, partner. [<i>Jake acts like a horse</i>]

[<i>Finn and Jake run to the cave.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, cloud! Where's Abadeer? Whoa, look at all these paintings. I think this is Hunson Abadeer's house.

[<i>The cloud arrives and reveals he's Abadeer.</i>]

<b>Hunson Abadeer</b>: Hey!

<b>Finn</b>: Hunson Abadeer!

<b>Hunson Abadeer</b>: How dare you chumps trespass here!

<b>Jake</b>: We just wanna go home, man.

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, why'd you lock us up, Abadeer? When Marceline finds out about this, it's gonna stir up some heavy daddy-daughter issues.

<b>Hunson Abadeer</b>: NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE!

<b>Jake</b>: Ah, come on, man!

[<i>Hunson Abadeer attacks Finn and Jake.</i>]

<b>Hunson Abadeer</b>: NO ONE! NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE!

[<i>Abadeer attacks Finn, but Finn blocks it with his sword. Jake tries to open a door, but Abadeer sees him.</i>]

<b>Hunson Abadeer</b>: Come with me, you juicy, little mortal soul!

[<i>Jake uses his powers to squeeze himself through the keyhole, leaving behind his camera phone and banana. Jake opens the door suddenly, hitting Abadeer.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Finn!

[<i>Finn runs through the door, while Jake hits Abadeer with the door again and gets his phone and the banana. Finn and Jake see the portal.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, my lob, Jake! You found the portal!

[<i>Abadeer smashes through the door. Finn and Jake scream and run into the portal. Abadeer attacks Finn again, and Jake wraps him up with his arm.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: We don't want to hurt you, Abadeer. Just let us go.

[<i>Abadeer laughs and throws Jake against the portal wall.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>groans</i>]

[<i>Abadeer tries to suck his soul, but Finn stabs him in the head. Black goo starts to squirt out.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What the—?

[<i>Marceline emerges from Abadeer's head.</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>: [<i>in unison</i>] MARCELINE?!

<b><a href="/wiki/Marceline" title="Marceline">Marceline</a></b>: I'm gonna close this portal. [<i>hisses</i>] You're forbidden to come back to the Nightosphere!

<b>Finn</b>: But Marcy, let us help you!

<b>Marceline</b>: It's too late! Stay away from me, FOREVVVEEERRRR!!!! [<i>the portal closes</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Marceline's in trouble! We gotta go back and save her.

<b>Jake</b>: Alright, but I'm gonna take a shower first.

[<i>Jake leaves and Finn smells his armpits and the episode ends.</i>]
