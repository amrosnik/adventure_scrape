[<i>The episode begins at <a href="/wiki/Iceberg_Lake" title="Iceberg Lake">Iceberg Lake</a> where <a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a> is lighting a flamethrower with a <a href="/wiki/Flambits" title="Flambits">flambit</a></i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah! [<i>Laughs and torches an iceberg</i>] Yeah!

[<i>The iceberg melts, exposing several objects inside</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I found another bike and more computers. What do you got?

<b>Jake</b>:  I keep finding baby shoes!

[<i>Jake torches an iceberg with his flamethrower and exposes more baby shoes</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></b>:  WHAT THE HECK, MAN?! And they're all lefties! Sorry I'm not finding any loot.

<b>Finn</b>:  Keep it together, chubby, because I think we found enough scrap to finish building our gauntlet dock; a dock that is also a gauntlet.

<b>Jake</b>:  Aww. Building this gauntlet dock is hard, man. Hard work sucks.

<b>Finn</b>:  Don't be lazy, Jake.

[<i>There's a bubbling noise coming from the lake behind Finn and Jake</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh?

<b>Jake</b>:  Incoming iceberg!

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa! That one's huge!

<b>Jake</b>:  I got dibs! Ooo. I hope it's not baby shoes.

[<i>Jake wipes the surface of the ice, which reveals a face within the ice</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] It's a guy.

<b>Finn</b>:  Creepy. It's a buncha guys.

<b>Jake</b>:  You know what they remind me of? Well-dressed pickles.

<b>Finn</b>:  Stand back, Jake! I'm gonna melt 'em outta there! Full charge.

[<i>Finn blasts a huge flame out of his flamethrower and Jake runs up to stop him</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa, don't roast 'em, man. You gotta flamb√©.

[<i>Jake gently brushes the flame across the iceberg and it soon melts</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Ah. Perfecto. Bon appetit.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey! Can you hear me? Hello?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Knocking on one of their heads</i>] I don't think they made it.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey. [<i>Reaching for a briefcase</i>] This one's got some kind of pack.

[<i>One of them comes to life and pushes Finn away; Finn screams</i>]

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  I remember... business.

<b>Finn</b>:  Let go! Let go! Let go!

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>: We... are <a href="/wiki/Business_Men" title="Business Men">Business Men</a>.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oooh... Well, I'm Finn and he's Jake.

<b>Jake</b>:  What kind of business do you do?

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Been frozen... so long, I... [<i>The businessmen all shake their heads, as if in pain</i>] can't remember. Can't remember! Oh. Looking for help, your business? We love work for you.

<b>Finn</b>:  Nah. Adventurers don't need any help.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yes! Help us fix that dock.

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Dock-ka?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah! Right over there.

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Yes. This dock-ka... could be more... efficient.

<b>Finn</b>:  No! Wait!

[<i>The businessmen reel back and murmur as if frightened</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, this dock is our fun pie. We should be the ones to bake it.

<b>Jake</b>:  But they're begging for it, Finn. Just look at 'em.

[<i>The businessmen look excited and several of them are drooling</i>]

<b>Businessmen</b>:  [<i>Murmuring</i>] Build dock. Build dock.

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn. These poor souls are lost without jobs. We can't ignore their plight.

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhh...

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To the businessmen</i>] Go on guys, fix it up!

<b>Businessmen</b>:  Woo!

[<i>The businessmen murmur excitedly as they run over to the dock and begin building</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Well... they do seem really happy to do it.

<b>Jake</b>:  Of course, man. They said they "love work for you."

<b>Businessmen</b>:  [<i>In unison</i>] Uhh... We finish.

[<i>The camera zooms out to show a completed gauntlet dock</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa!

<b>Jake</b>:  Told ya so.

<b>Finn</b>:  Come on! Let's try it out!

[<i>Finn and Jake run through the gauntlet dock, avoiding the traps and obstacles, while Finn screams excitedly</i>]

[<i>At the end of the dock, Finn and Jake jump into the water</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughing</i>] Yeah! Woo!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Laughing</i>] Yeah! Woo! [<i>Panting</i>] See? If we hire them full time, they'll be back in business and we'll be able to focus on fun stuff. Everybody wins!

<b>Finn</b>:  Maybe you're right.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To the businessmen</i>] You hear that, guys? Maybe I'm right!

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Really? Job? With... ad-ven-tur-ers?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, mans!

[<i>The businessmen cheer and dance</i>]

[<i>The red-tie businessman throws down his briefcase and chisels "Fin [</i>sic<i>] &amp; Jake Adventuring Incorporated" into the side</i>]

[<i>The scene changes to the Tree Fort where the businessmen are cleaning weapons, ironing socks and shining shoes</i>]

[<i>Jake is playing a video game on BMO</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Feels weird doing nothing.

<b>Jake</b>:  Relax, man. This is your day off.

<b><a href="/wiki/Hot_Dog_Princess" title="Hot Dog Princess">Hot Dog Princess</a></b>: [<i>From far in the distance</i>] Help! Somebody help!

<b>Finn</b>:  Trouble, dude! Get your axe! I'll get my... wha?

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Adventure pack... ready for you.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, thanks man.

[<i>The scene changes to Finn and Jake running across the Grass Lands, weapons in hand</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I have to say, Jake. My sword is totally shiny and stinkin' sharp!

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh huh.

<b>Finn</b>:  Even my shoes feel different. Not only are they clean, I feel radder, faster, more... adequate.

<b>Jake</b>:  Cool!

[<i>The businessmen are running behind Finn and Jake, writing notes</i>]

[<i>A battle cube is chasing Hot Dog Princess</i>]

<b>Hot Dog Princess</b>:  Help!

<b>Finn</b>:  Don't cry, Hot Dog Princess! Jake and I will fend off these battle cubes!

[<i>The businessmen sit off to the side and continue to take notes while eating donuts and drinking coffee</i>]

[<i>Finn and Jake begin to fight the battle cubes, which are flying around Hot Dog Princess' kingdom</i>]

[<i>The scene fades to a later time, where everyone is tired from fighting and Hot Dog Princess is taking a nap</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Man. I'm getting tired.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Groan</i>] Me too. These cubes are... frickin' resilient. Hey, business dudes! Hold off these cubes so we can catch our breath?

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake! They don't know how to fight.

[<i>The businessmen run over, wearing armor and wielding weapons; they begin fighting the battle cubes while Finn and Jake rest</i>]

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  [<i>Offering bottled water and orange slices</i>] Water. Orange slices. Help rehydrate.

[<i>Red-tie businessman runs back into battle, shouting</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  These guys are great, right?

<b>Finn</b>:  I gotta admit... they are helping. [<i>Surprised</i>] Oh! I think I figured out how to defeat the battle cubes!

<b>Jake</b>:  That's 'cause you had time to rest your body and refresh your brain.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To businessmen</i>] Ok! We'll take it from here, guys!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah! Good work.

[<i>Finn and Jake run towards the battle cubes; Jake roars and grows large</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Grab all the cubes together!

[<i>Jake stretches his hands to become giant and clasps them together, grabbing all the cubes</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Got 'em!

[<i>Finn grunts and jumps into Jake's hands with a rope and ties all the battle cubes together into a single, large cube</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  It worked!

[<i>Jake throws the cubes off into the distances</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Wake up, Hot Dog Princess. You're free.

<b>Hot Dog Princess</b>:  Oh! Thank you, Finn and Jake! Especially you, Finn.

[<i>Hot Dog Princess stands on her hind legs and puckers her lips, as if to give Finn a kiss</i>]

[<i>Finn rears back, disgusted</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Whispering to Jake</i>] Ugh. She smells like old hot dog water.

[<i>Jake giggles and the red-tie businessman runs in between Finn and Hot Dog Princess to take the kiss instead</i>]

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  [<i>Whispering to Finn</i>] I take one for team.

<b>Finn</b>:  This is awesome! You get a promotion, fella.

[<i>Red-tie businessman cheers and dances</i>]

<b>businessman</b>:  Take one for team, too.

[<i>The other businessmen begin kissing Hot Dog Princess</i>]

[<i>The scene changes to the Tree Fort where Finn and Jake are playing BMO</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh... Lost again!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Grabbing the controller</i>] My turn.

[<i>Jake walks over to the businessmen, operating a large collection of wires and monitors</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  What's that?

[<i>Jake goes to the freezer and takes out a tub of ice cream</i>]

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Hero vision monitor. Use satellite to tell us world problems.

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, wow. Anything going on?

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Just small things. You save stress for big thing.

<b>Jake</b>:  Freakin' awesome, man.

<b>Finn</b>:  What are they doing?

<b>Jake</b>:  Takin' care of business.

[<i>Jake eats a scoop of ice cream and Finn plays the video game</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, hit me!

[<i>Jake flings a scoop of ice cream into Finn's mouth</i>]

[<i>Time passes, showing more and more empty ice cream tubs stacked near Finn and Jake while both of them are getting fatter and fatter</i>]

<b>Video game</b>:  Mission complete.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah!

[<i>Finn and Jake get up and dance around, shaking their enormous guts</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  We beat Adventure Master!

<b>Jake</b>:  Holy moly!

<b>Finn</b>:  We're adventure masters!

<b>Jake</b>:  Woo! Yes!

[<i>Finn and Jake both get tired and stop celebrating to take a breath</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Tired</i>] Ooo.

<b>Finn</b>:  I never knew being fat and lazy was so rewarding.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah. [<i>pushing around Finn's gut</i>] You're gut's so huge and moldable.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey!

<b>Jake</b>:  Hold on a sec!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] Man, that tickles.

[<i>Jake manipulates Finn's gut to look like the Ice King</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Impersonating Ice King's voice</i>] I'm the Ice King, and I'll never find a bride because I'm such a tool.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] Alright, let me try.

[<i>Finn manipulates his gut to look like Princess Bubblegum</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Impersonating Princess Bubblegum's voice</i>] I'm Princess Bubblegum and I'm a dork, because I like science! I've also got a really annoying voice that Finn thinks is attractive!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] That's a- Hey, what'd you say?

<b><a href="/wiki/Lumpy_Space_Princess" title="Lumpy Space Princess">Lumpy Space Princess</a></b>: [<i>On a hero vision monitor, running from a <a href="/wiki/Swamp_Giant" title="Swamp Giant">Swamp Giant</a></i>] Ahh! Oh, my gosh! Leave me alone. All I said was "you're ugly," which is totally true. Somebody help me! Oh no!

<b>Jake</b>:  Man, I am not in the mood for saving Lumpy Space Princess.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, business dudes!

[<i>The businessmen enter the room from various directions</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What do you guys think?

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Hmm... Just one monster. We do.

[<i>The businessmen run off</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Right. We'll just save our strength for the big adventures, then.

[<i>Finn and Jake sit back down on their couch and relax</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Ahh. Nice call, dude.

<b>Finn</b>:  Imagine how awesome the adventure's going to be when it's time for us to go out there.

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm too tired to imagine stuff, but I bet you're right.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Both grabbing a tub of ice cream and toasting with them</i>] To being great adventurers!

[<i>They both begin eating ice cream; time passes and shows that they have empty tubs and ice cream all over their faces. They are even fatter, and Finn's gut is now visible outside his shirt</i>]

[<i>Finn and Jake both groan and waiver until they fall over</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, gosh.

<b>A voice in the distance</b>:  Help us!

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh? Jake! Did you hear that?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah. Let the businessmen handle it.

<b>A voice in the distance</b>:  Help! Please!

<b>Finn</b>:  I heard it again.

<b>Jake</b>:  businessmen, dude.

<b>A voice in the distance</b>:  Heeeeeelp!

[<i>Finn walks over to the window and gasps, seeing the businessmen in a large robot, sucking up <a href="/wiki/Fuzzy_Friends" title="Fuzzy Friends">Fuzzy Friends</a> into a container</i>]

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  [<i>Through a PA system</i>] Woo-hoo! Woo!

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake! We messed up! The businessmen have gone bat-crazy, dude!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Still lying on the floor</i>] Man, just let the businessmen handle it.

<b>Finn</b>:  THE BUSINESSMEN ARE THE PROBLEM, you lazy plug-hole!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Opens his eyes, surprised</i>] Huh?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Yelling out the window</i>] Guys!

[<i>Finn begins to climb out the window and down to the bottom of the Tree Fort</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Guys, stop it!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Running up to the businessmen's robot</i>] Stop it, guys!

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Stop what, boss?

<b>Finn</b>:  You're jacking up those Fuzzy Friends!

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  But... We're being heroes. Like you, boss. We're protecting them. Collecting them in our care-sack so they cannot be hurt. It's the most efficient way to save people.

<b>Finn</b>:  But you're making them unhappy!

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Irrelevant! These people are in our care-sack. Their happiness is not priority.

<b>Finn</b>:  I am your boss! And you guys are all fired!

[<i>The businessmen begin to murmur to each other</i>]

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Fi-red?

[<i>The businessmen shout angrily and start sucking up the Fuzzy Friends even faster than before</i>]

[<i>They move their robot and it crushes one of the Fuzzy Friends</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Nooo! Alright, guys. Now I've gotta take you down... Finn style.

[<i>Finn runs over to kick their robot, and gets sucked up into the care-sack</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm kicking your care-sack, dudes!

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn? Whoa... Crud.

[<i>Jake squeezes his enormous gut out the window</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm comin' buddy!

[<i>Jake flops onto the ground, still holding a tub of ice cream</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Ahh. I'm so fat, dude; I don't know what to do.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Gasp</i>] That's it! Jake! Demoralize them!

<b>Jake</b>:  What? Why?

<b>Finn</b>:  Do it, man! I have a legit plan!

<b>Jake</b>:  Ok, Alright. [<i>To businessmen</i>] Hey! You guys are horrible at business!

[<i>The businessmen lash about angrily and try to suck Jake up into their care-sack, but he's too fat to fit</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Huh? They're sucking me up, dude!

<b>Finn</b>:  Now, eat that ice cream some more to become fatter, while also using your Stretchy Powers to grow huge!

[<i>Jake chows down on the ice cream and starts getting bigger</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>lifting his head up for a second</i>] Ok!

[<i>Jake uses his Stretchy Powers as he gets pulled into the robot</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  This sucks.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, dude! Keep growin'! You're breaking apart their robot!

[<i>The robot begins to shake violently, the businessmen scream</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh no!

[<i>The robot explodes and Finn, Jake and the businessmen go flying into the air</i>]

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  [<i>Attempting to grab Finn</i>] I'm going to kill you, not-boss!

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait, man! Wait! I wanna re-hire you guys!

<b>Red-tie businessman</b>:  Re-hire? Really?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, mans.

<b>Businessmen</b>:  Woo hoo!

[<i>As they all fall back to the ground, the businessmen and Finn grasp hands and form a five-point star</i>]

[<i>The scene changes to a beach, where Finn, Jake and the Fuzzy Friends are waving towards the water</i>]

<b>Fuzzy Friends</b>:  Yay! Hip-hip hooray! Pancakes!

[<i>The businessmen are once again frozen in an iceberg and float back out to the middle of the lake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  So, wait... What'd you hire them to do?

<b>Finn</b>:  I hired them to stuff themselves in that iceberg and get outta here.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Sigh</i>] I'm gonna miss 'em. And I'm gonna miss this gut.

[<i>Jake uses his Stretchy Powers to return to his normal size</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] I'm gonna miss my gut too.

[<i>Finn strains and attempts to suck in his gut like Jake, but it doesn't disappear</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Aww! Aww...

[<i>The camera zooms in to Finn's frowning face, and "The End" appears on the top of his hat. The episode ends</i>]
