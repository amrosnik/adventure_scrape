<b>Jake</b>: No! [<i>slaps orb out of Finn's mouth</i>] Don't put that biz in your mouth, man! They could be booby-trapped or poisoned or—

<b>Marceline</b>: Whoa, chill, Jake. These pearls were dropped by The Moon. Her main power is accelerated healing. It'll be like fighting a cutting board.

<b>Jake</b>: Hmm. Okay. Anyways, we should try to find her before—[<i>Finn pushes a pearl against Jake's cheek</i>] No! [<i>pushes it away</i>]

[<i>He and Finn tussle, shoving the pearl into each other's face.</i>]
