Cause when I'm alone I can just sit on the couch and I'm hungry I can eat whatever I want. It's not like: [<i>High pitched voice</i>] "What should we eat for breakfast? Wait! We should coordinate!" [<i>Normal voice</i>] That's a pain.

<b>Prismo</b>:  Wait, dude! Look, I like you, so you should know my wishes always got an ironic twist to them. It's like a monkey's paw kind of thing.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Shrinks back to normal</i>] What?

<b>Prismo</b>:  You just gotta be <i>really</i> specific. Say your wish is: "I wish for a back rub." Who's gonna give it to you? A dirty man? A bear? And where does this "masseuse" come from? Do I zap some guy away from his family dinner? Leave some kid traumatized?

<b>Cosmic Owl</b>:  Woo!

<b>Prismo</b>:  [<i>Nasal voice</i>] Mom, where did dad go? [<i>High pitched voice</i>] Oh, I don't know son he just disappeared from the table... sorry.
