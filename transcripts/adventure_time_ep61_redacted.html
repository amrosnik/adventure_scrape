<b>Jake</b>: Don't worry, bro. We won't tell anyone about the private time you spend with your wad of <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a>'s hair.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Blushing</i>] You guys knew?

<b>Jake</b>: Finn, we're roommates. Which is why I'm gonna share my beloved keepsake with you.

What <i>is</i> this gripagrap?!<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/Adventure_Time_Wiki:Citations" title="Adventure Time Wiki:Citations"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  It's the door of the Door Lord, Finn. We used to lock them up, but they kept breaking out. 'Cause they're Door Lords.

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>Wearing a sunhat and gloves</i>] They broke out because you let them live.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Angered grunt</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmm? The door said it will open for genuine band. Let's try and music this door open as a quintet.

<b>Jake</b>:  Can I be the jerk it the band? 'Cause that's an important part of a band's success. [<i>Shrinks face</i>] <i>Hmph.</i>

<b>Marceline</b>:  I know how to get through this door. We're gonna lay down a chill jam.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah!

<b>Marceline</b>:  Just keep it cool. Got that princess?

<b>Marceline</b>:  ...To bury you in the ground... and drink the blood from your... Ugh!

[<i>Door stops glowing</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>At Princess Bubblegum</i>] Stop staring at me! Ugh, you threw me off!

<b>Finn</b>: Come on, everybody! Don't stop now. The door was responding to our music! I wonder what it liked or what was missing.

<b>Jake</b>:  Well, I know what's missing. Talent. I'm getting out of here, you hacks! Talentless hacks! [<i>Leaves</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  Yikes.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Takes off his backpack</i>] Maybe to be a genuine band we need to be nicer to each other and hang out as buds. [<i>Pulls out a noodle cake</i>] Let's take a noodle break. Come on, it will help!

[<i>Marceline flies off</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: No! Wait, don't go, too!

<b>Marceline</b>: I'm just gonna get stuff to cook that.

[<i>Finn has already taken a bite of the noodle cake and puts his backpack back on</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Cook?

[<i>Marceline flies back into the door from her house</i>]

[<i>Jake comes back dressed like a punk rocker</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hmph!

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, you're back!

<b>Jake</b>: Shut yo' face. I came back for the music.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: BMO, execute Sound Structure Alpha. [<i>BMO begins to play a song</i>] Marceline, begin playing triplet quavers in mixolydian mode.

<b>Marceline</b>:  Alright, fine. [<i>Begins to play her Ax bass</i>] Wait, what's a quaver?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Now, Finn, vibrate your uvula by dampening and undampening your larynx.

<b>Finn</b>: Wha?

<b>Princes Bubblegum</b>: [<i>Rubbing her neck, vibrating her voice</i>] Go like this, silly.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh. [<i>Does it</i>] Whaaaa...

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Okay, okay. Jake, are you gonna join in?

[<i>Jake smashes his viola, Marceline looks agitated</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Everyone, just stick to my blueprints. [<i>Gasps</i>] [<i>BMO catches fire</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: Oohh...

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Sighs</i>] One more time?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I may have, um... miscalculated.

<b>Marceline</b>: Ha! Looks like you aren't as perfect as you thought. Guess you can't judge me anymore.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I never said you had to be perfect!

<b>Finn</b>: Alright, time out, guys.

[<i>Marceline spits on Princess Bubblegum causing her to recoil in shock and leave, with BMO following</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Princess! Princess, wait!

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>Hisses</i>] Whatever, [<i>Eyes start to water</i>] Ugh! I'm outta here, too! [<i>Leaves</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Marceline?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Cries</i>] You've all forgotten 'bout the music! I quit the band! [<i>Runs away backwards</i>] I'm just pretending!

<b>Finn</b>: Jake! Everybody! We can beat the Door Lord! ...Together.

[<i>Finn sings "<a href="/wiki/My_Best_Friends_in_the_World" title="My Best Friends in the World">My Best Friends in the World</a>," reunites the band, and opens the door of the Door Lord. Inside the Door Lord is eating a sandwich.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: It's over, Door Lord.

<b>Jake</b>: So hand over our stuff.

<b>Door Lord</b>: Hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmmhmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm hmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmm!

<b>Finn</b>: What's he trying to say?

<b>Marceline</b>: I totally get it. He may have stolen <i>our</i> treasures...

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: ...But by doing so, he showed us...

<b>Jake</b>: ...That the real treasure is friendship.

<b>Door Lord</b>: [<i>Happy</i>] Mmmhmmhmm! Mmmhmm hmmhmmhmm.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>Rushes towards it</i>] It's mine! That's mine.

<b>Marceline</b>: You... kept the shirt I gave you?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Yeah. It, uh, means a lot to me.

<b>Marceline</b>: But you never wore it.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Puts it on</i>] Dude, I wear it all the time... as pajamas.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait, if that's Bubblegum's shirt, what are <i>you</i> missing, Marceline?

[<i>Marceline is dead silent</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Wait a second, wait a second! You don't <i>have</i> a thing! You just wanted to hang out with us!

<b>Marceline</b>: No, I didn't!

<b>Finn</b>: No way, you're caught! I figured you out! [<i>Laughs</i>]

<i>[Marceline turns into a monster]</i>

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>Playfully</i>] I'll kill you!
