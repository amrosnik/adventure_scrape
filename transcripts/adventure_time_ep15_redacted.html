[<i>Finn and Jake chase a Fire Newt to the ocean</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>:  Come back, thief!

[<i>The <a href="/wiki/Fire_Newt" title="Fire Newt">Fire Newt</a> spews fire at Finn and <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa!

<b>Fire Newt</b>:  Stop farting on me! It's gross!

<b>Finn</b>:  You can't just go around stealing boots.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, and you know the penalty for stealing boots. It's poots... on newts.

<b>Both</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>]

[<i>The Fire Newt wades into the ocean to avoid Finn and Jake</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  He's getting away in that lake!

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude, that isn't a lake. That's an ocean.

[<i>Jake stretches and heads towards the ocean, a poot following behind, barking</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughs and runs after Jake</i>] Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! ...Huh?

[<i>The hue of the ocean and sky changes to red and ominous music plays as a wave crashes</i>]

[<i>Finn backs away from the water as it washes onto land</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhh...

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Laughing and farting on the Newt</i>] Poots on newts! Poots on newts!

<b>Fire Newt</b>:  No!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Slow-motion</i>] Poots on newts!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>laughs and starts removing his shoes</i>] I'm coming, Jake. I'll poot on that newt as soon as I'm barefoot. Uh...

[<i>The ocean turns a red hue again and ominous music plays as a wave crashes</i>]

[<i>Finn gasps and rapidly crawls away from the water</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Breaths heavily, his stomach rumbles</i>] Ow! Why is my stomach going nuts?

[<i>A black smoke rises out of Finn's navel</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ow!

[<i>The smoke forms into a face and laughs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Wh-wh-wh-Who are you?

<b><a href="/wiki/Fear_Feaster" title="Fear Feaster">Fear Feaster</a></b>:  I am the manifestation of your fear... fear of the ocean!

<b>Finn</b>:  What? I'm not afraid of lakes, wells, or rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles. Why would I be afraid of- [<i>Screams and backs away from the water</i>]

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] 'Cause you're a wuss.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm no wuss! I'm the hero around these parts!

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  Ha! You're too scared of the ocean to ever be a true hero.

<b>Finn</b>:  Not true! I'm not scared of nothin'!

[<i>Finn charges towards the ocean, screaming, but stops when he sees a wave crash</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Shakes his head and takes a deep breath</i>] I shall conquer my fear.

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  Yeah, right.

<b>Finn</b>:  No! I will. I'll conquer my fear.

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  Of course you will, [<i>Receding back into Finn's navel</i>] and I live in a two bedroom apartment that doesn't smell like vomit [<i>Laughs</i>] ...Sarcasm.

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude. Dude, did you see me? I was all like womp, and then I was all like take this! Womp! Womp! And then... Hey, what’s wrong with you, dude?

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake. I think I'm afraid... of the ocean.

<b>Jake</b>:  Say what, now?

<b>Finn</b>:  I need your help to overcome my fear. Will you do it?

<b>Jake</b>:  Um... No... I don't really wanna do it.

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake! Come on!

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm just messing with you. I'll do it. Hmm... Where to start? Oh, ok. I think we should just take a few steps in the water. You can hold Jake's hand if you're scared.

[<i>Jake grabs Finn's hand and starts walking towards the water, but Finn doesn't walk and falls over</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Um... Oh it's ok, dude. I see the problem. It's just your feet.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Manually moving Finn's feet forward one at a time</i>] Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop.

<b>Finn</b>:  Don't be scared. I shall not be scared.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Still moving Finn's feet</i>] Boop. Boop.

[<i>The water touches Finn's feet</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm afraid! Ah! [<i>Jumps on top of Jake and starts punching him</i>] Jake, get me out of the water! Now, Jake! Now! Now!

[<i>Jake inflates his head and walks Finn back to shore</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hot jam! You're really scared of the ocean. In fact, you're so scared... it gives me an idea. Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean!

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake!

<b>Jake</b>:  Ok. Ok. I have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning.

<b>Finn</b>:  But I must conquer this now! [<i>Runs towards the ocean screaming</i>] I'm not afraid of you!

[<i>Multiple waves crash directly in front of Finn in rapid succession and a single droplet hits Finn's face</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>reels back in slow-motion and screams</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Running backwards</i>] I'm afraid of you! I'm afraid of you! [<i>Screams</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Exhaustedly crawls to Jake's feet</i>] Ok, yeah. Let's try tomorrow.

[<i>The scene changes to Finn and Jake's bedroom where Jake is sitting on top of a sleeping Finn</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Fiiiinn. Finn. Hey, Finn. Wake up.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Opens his eyes</i>] Morning, Jake.

<b>Jake</b>:  Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, man.

<b>Jake</b>:  Cool... but I can only do this if you ask me.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm askin'!

<b>Jake</b>:  Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one!

[<i>Jake punches the bedroom wall and the entire structure breaks apart, leaving Finn and Jake floating on Finn's bed in the middle of the ocean</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Screams</i>] Jake, are you crazy? This is not an OK thing to do!

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey. Hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends.

<b>Finn</b>:  You're nuts. [<i>Wriggles from side to side</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Don't try to struggle, man. [<i>Pulls the blankets back, revealing that Finn is tied to the bed</i>] I'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down.

<b>Finn</b>:  Really? Ok. I'm calming down.

<b>Jake</b>:  That's great. You're doing great. Ready for step two?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Breathing heavily</i>] Yeah, man. I can do it.

<b>Jake</b>:  Alright, dude. Step... two! [<i>Unties the rope</i>]

[<i>The bed collapses and falls into the ocean, leaving Finn floating inside his sleeping bag and Jake on top of him</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Screams</i>] Jake, this isn't a joke! It's touching me!

<b>Jake</b>:  Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Heart pounding</i>] I'm trying to let it hold me.

<b>Jake</b>:  Control your breathing!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Breathes in and out</i>] This isn't working!

<b>Jake</b>:  That means we gotta move to step three. Just don't scream.

<b>Finn</b>:  W-what?

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream.

[<i>Jake pushes Finn's head underwater</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Don't scream. Hold your breath, Finn. You got it, dude!

[<i>Finn screams and bursts out of his sleeping bag, sending Jake flying into the water</i>]

[<i>Finn jumps onto Jake's head and starts pounding on him</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Get me away, Jake! Now, Jake! Now! Right now! Get-Get me away! [<i>Screams</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow!

[<i>Finn grabs Jake's ears and stretches them until they catch wind and carry both Finn and Jake to an island of pre-war ruins</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] I'm safe! I'm safe! How'd I do?

<b>Jake</b>:  I think we should give up.

<b>Finn</b>:  What? I made it all the way to level three.

<b>Jake</b>:  Look, Finn. It's not that I don't want to help you... I just don't wanna get beat up anymore. I mean this [<i>Pointing to his face</i>] is my bread and butter. I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude.

<b>Finn</b>:  You have to help me. I can't do this without you.

<b>Jake</b>:  Ok. Fine... but only if you swear not to hit me anymore.

<b>Finn</b>:  I swear I won't hit you anymore.

<b>Jake</b>:  And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times.

<b>Finn</b>:  I swear... and pigs have hair.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yes. Perfect. And since you want more... it's time for step four.

<b>Finn</b>:  What? I thought you said it was a three step plan... man.

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm not that good at counting. [<i>Laughs and grabs a small, rusty submarine</i>] Come on. Let's go kick your fear of the ocean where the sun don't shine... in the sea cucumber.

[<i>The scene changes to underwater where Finn and Jake are heading to the ocean floor in the submarine</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Check it, dude. One hundred percent awesome-itude.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Eyes closed, breathes heavily and shivers</i>] Yeah. It's pretty math... you psychopath.

<b>Jake</b>:  You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Opens his eyes</i>] Whoa...

<b>Jake</b>:  See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey. This isn't that bad. I'm actually glad.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Points</i>] Hey, look! A black abyss! Let's go check it out... sauerkraut.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around!

[<i>Finn sees the Fear Feaster's face appear in front of the abyss</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Noooo!

<b>Jake</b>:  Saying, "Turn around" twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude.

[<i>Finn pushes Jake away from the submarine controls</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey, you swore!

[<i>Finn pummels Jake</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Ow! My bread and butter!

[<i>Finn grabs the controls and jerks them violently</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  No, dude! Don't!

[<i>The submarine moves wildly and launches torpedoes, one of which hits a building</i>]

[<i>The building topples and hits the submarine, causing it to start filling up with water</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Don't worry, dude. Everything's cool. This is the perfect segue into level five. [<i>Handing Finn a dive suit</i>] Here, put this on.

[<i>Finn starts putting on the suit</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab.

[<i>Finn pulls the emergency tab</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  No, dude! I said don't...

[<i>Finn's suit expands rapidly and knocks Jake back, hitting his head against a valve and knocking him out</i>]

[<i>Finn floats to the surface and watches Jake descend into the abyss along with the broken submarine</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake? Jaaaaaake!

[<i>Finn reaches the surface and jumps onto a buoy</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake!

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] Pathetic! You can't even overcome your fear now that your friend is about to die! Your un-heroic body will never let you save Jake. [<i>Laughs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Sadly</i>] You're right.

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  What? Really? You think I'm right? Well, that's... that's great!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Holding a wrench</i>] If my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do.

[<i>Finn removes his helmet, hits himself on the head with the wrench and falls into the ocean</i>]

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  No. Wait. No! Noooo!

[<i>Finn lands on the ocean floor and wakes up next to Jake</i>]

[<i>Jake groans</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake! Jake! Wake up!

[<i>Jake opens his eyes</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  You ok, dude?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, man. Wait... Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear!

<b>Finn</b>:  What?

<b>Jake</b>:  You're at the bottom of the ocean!

[<i>Finn screams and tries to pull his emergency tab, but nothing happens</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Maybe we should celebrate on land.

[<i>Jake grabs Finn and pulls his own emergency tab, so they both float to the surface</i>]

[<i>Finn and Jake run onto the beach and fall backwards</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm proud of you man. You did it!

<b>Finn</b>:  Thanks, dude.

[<i>Fear Feaster comes out of Finn's navel</i>]

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  You've nothing to be proud of, boy! You will never get of your fear of the ocean!

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To Fear Feaster</i>] What the flip, man? I just swam to the bottom!

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  No you didn't, cheater! You just sank to the bottom. You will never be a great hero.

<b>Finn</b>:  He's right. I'll never be a hero.

[<i>Finn's stomach rumbles and a black-smoke limousine comes out of him and parks nearby</i>]

[<i>The limousine’s windows roll down and Three Wise Men come out</i>]

<b>Wise Man 1</b>:  Finn, you are wrong. The mark of a great hero is his flaw.

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  You know nothing, Wise Men!

<b>Wise Man 1</b>:  Silence, Fear Feaster! We know a lot!

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait... Why did you wait so long to tell me?

<b>Wise Man 1</b>:  Because the limo driver's flaw is being late!

<b><a href="/wiki/Limousine_Driver" title="Limousine Driver">Limo Driver</a></b>: Sorry. [<i>rolls up window</i>]

<b>Wise Man 1</b>:  Farewell, Finn. You truly are the greatest hero of Ooo.

[<i>The Wise Men go back inside the limo and then the limo drives back into Finn</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  It's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster!

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  What? Am I supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life?

<b>Finn</b>:  Everybody has a flaw... and it looks like yours is smelling like my nasty guts.

[<i>Fear Feaster heads back into Finn's stomach</i>]

<b>Fear Feaster</b>:  [<i>Sarcastically</i>] Wonderful...

<b>Pat McHale</b>:  And so fear is forced deep within the soul of a hero. Conquered... at least, for now... [<i>Maniacal laugh</i>]

[<i>The episode ends</i>]
