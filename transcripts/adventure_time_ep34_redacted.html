<b><a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a></b>: [<i>voice over</i>] In the <a href="/wiki/Land_of_Ooo" title="Land of Ooo">Kingdom of Ooo</a> there is a galaxy of flavors, but only one taste sensation is amazing enough to kill for—<a href="/wiki/Royal_tart" title="Royal tart">the Royal tart</a>. [<i>Royal tart appears on screen</i>] [<i>four hands appear and split the tart in four</i>] Royal tarts are very rare. They are only eaten at the most sacred gathering in Ooo—<a href="/wiki/Back-Rubbing_Ceremony" title="Back-Rubbing Ceremony">the annual Back-Rubbing Ceremony</a> [<i><a href="/wiki/Backrubbers" title="Backrubbers">Backrubbers</a> appear, rubbing each other's backs</i>]. The tart is so legendary that countless thieves will risk their lives for just one bite. [<i>Thieves appear and grab the tart, then a bite mark appears on the tart</i>]

[<i>Scene changes to <a href="/wiki/Candy_Kingdom" title="Candy Kingdom">Candy Kingdom</a></i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: My head will be decapitated if the tarts don't make it to the ceremony. I only trust one guy to deliver them... the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Tart_Toter" title="Royal Tart Toter" class="mw-redirect">Royal Tart Toter</a>.

[<i>Royal Tart Toter appears, then zooms back to reveal it is just a picture of him.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></b>: Whoa!

<b>Jake</b>: He's magnificent!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: He used to be, but he's gone mad and old. So he can't deliver the tarts anymore. <a href="/wiki/Cinnamon_Bun" title="Cinnamon Bun">Cinnamon Bun</a> offered to fill the position, but he's kind of...[<i>whispers</i>] half-baked.

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Hey Princess! Here I go! [<i>slowly stands on his head while grunting</i>] I'm stuck.

<b>Finn</b>: Princess, let us deliver the tarts.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Are you sure Finn? This is really important.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>getting down on one knee</i>] Princess, I have never been more sure of anything in my whole life! [<i>rubs the princess' hand on his face</i>] I'll do anything it takes to keep you alive and safe. We won't let you down.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Well... I accept your offer.

[<i>Scene changes to a factory where <a href="/wiki/Jelly_Bean_People" title="Jelly Bean People">Jelly Bean People</a> are working.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Welcome to the <a href="/wiki/Tartorium" title="Tartorium">Tartorium</a>!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>looking at some tarts, along with Jake</i>] Wow. [<i>along with Jake</i>] They're so beautiful.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No, boys. Those are the reject tarts, full of imperfections. [<i>lifts container full of tarts</i>] <i>These</i> are the perfect tarts... [<i>she kisses the container</i>] safely packed into one of my <a href="/wiki/Anti-gravity_tote_chamber" title="Anti-gravity tote chamber">anti-gravity tote chambers</a>.

[<i>She hands them the chamber</i>]

<b>Finn and Jake</b>: Tote sweet!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Now, I want you to tote those tarts through that tunnel. [<i>she takes out her <a href="/wiki/Holo_technology" title="Holo technology">holo-pendant</a> and shows them a map</i>] The <a href="/wiki/Royal_Tart_Path" title="Royal Tart Path">Royal Tart Path</a> takes you directly to the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Congressional_Hall" title="Royal Congressional Hall">Royal Congressional Hall</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Bad_Lands" title="Bad Lands">Bad Lands</a>. The path is really safe and well protected, but keep your eyes open for any sign of danger, okay?

<b>Finn</b>: Mmm hmm.

<b>Jake</b>: Yep.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Good. Now here's your map. [<i>gives them the holo-pendant</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>picking up a beaker</i>] Hey Princess, what are all these bubbling chemicals all over the place?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: That's <a href="/wiki/Paralyzing_potion" title="Paralyzing potion">paralyzing potion</a>, Finn! Don't touch it. It'll paralyze you forever! [<i>she laughs nervously</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Oh. [<i>he puts the potion back</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Thank you, boys.[<i>steps into an elevator</i>] And remember, my head is on the line! [<i>She pulls her head back before the elevator doors close on her.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: All right, let's hit it. [<i>starts to move towards the tunnel</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Wait. I got a sick plan! [<i>He takes an empty anti-gravity chamber, fills it with reject tarts, pours some paralyzing potion on them, and sets the pack on Cinnamon Bun's back, and the two laugh.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Go!

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Okay. [<i>He walks into the tunnel waving good-bye.</i>] Bye! Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Bye!

<b>Finn</b>:  Goodbye! You'll be fine! Hahaha!

<b>Jake</b>:  Bye! Goodbye!

[<i>All three say that at the same time</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Heh, that was fun, but why'd you do it?

<b>Finn</b>:  Look, everyone expects the tarts to on that Royal Tart Path. Cinnamon Bun will be our decoy while we take the one path no thief expect a tart toter to take: the <a href="/wiki/Desert_of_Doom" title="Desert of Doom">Desert of Doom</a>!

[<i>The scene changes to the Desert of Doom in the Bad Lands, with Finn and Jake walking with Anti-Gravity Chamber</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  I guess this is it.

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh, not as scary as I thought it'd be.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, man, mostly just looks empty. I mean, what thief would ever hang out here? There's nothing to steal!

<b>Finn</b>:  You know, I think my plan might be kinda brilliant. I mean, I'm not saying <i>I'm</i> the brilliant, but it's a pretty brilliant plan, I think.

<b>Jake</b>:  True, true. This place is perfect for toting tarts.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, and the Back-Rubbing Ceremony is right over those mountains. [<i>points to mountains</i>] This tart tote is gonna be a total tart walk.

<b>Jake</b>:  Heheheh, yeah. Ohh, wait! Hold up!

<b>Finn</b>:  What is it?

<b>Jake</b>:  Shh. [<i>sniffs</i>] It's a campfire—close by.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>gasps</i>] Does it smell like a tart thief's campfire?

<b>Jake</b>:  Maybe.

<b>Finn</b>:  Better check it out—can't be too careful. [<i>pats the tart pack</i>]

[<i>The scene switches to three hobos roasting a sausage</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Taddle" title="Taddle">Taddle</a></b>:  D-d-don't burn it now, Grimby.

<b><a href="/wiki/Grimby" title="Grimby">Grimby</a></b>:  Hush. [<i>blows sausage</i>] I ain't gon' burn it.

[<i>Finn and Jake see this and hide</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Crud! I was sure we'd be safe in the Desert of Doom!

<b>Jake</b>:  What? Whatcha sayin'?

<b>Finn</b>:  Those are dirty tart burglers!

<b>Jake</b>:  I think they're just dirty hobos.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, man, they are cold-blooded tart destroyers and we have to get them before they get us.

<b>Jake</b>:  Why?

<b>Finn</b>:  They're gonna kill Princess Bubblegum by stealin' our tarts!

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, yeah.

[<i>The scene switches to the hobos</i>]

<b>Taddle</b>:  But how come <a href="/wiki/JJ" title="JJ">JJ</a> gets to hold it, Grimby?

[<i>Jake appears, transformed into a monster, and the hobos are scared</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Rawr! [<i>hits Taddle</i>]

[<i>Grimby tries to eat the beans but Finn hits him</i>]

[<i>Jake kicks JJ</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, go on, get! We'll mash you up crazy! [<i>Points at Grimby</i>] You! Listen up and tell your friends: the next time you wanna steal one of our tarts—!

<b>Grimby</b>:  [<i>gasps</i>] You got tarts?

<b>Finn</b>:  You know we do! And the next time you want to steal one—! [<i>JJ approaches the tart pack</i>] You picture this guy right here [<i>points to Jake</i>] chewin' on your brain! [<i>JJ inserts his arm into the tart pack, but it sounds an alarm</i>] What the—?! [<i>JJ steals some tarts</i>] That thing's gettin' the tarts!

[<i>Jake reaches for him, but JJ jet-packs away with the tarts</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Son of a—.

[<i>JJ lands in the distance, and the other hobos approach him</i>]

<b>Taddle and Grimby</b>:  We eatin' good tonight! [<i>They fly away with JJ</i>]

[<i>Jake returns to its normal shape and observes the tart pack</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh-oh, man, he got, like, five or six!

<b>Finn</b>:  But... my brilliant plan.

<b>Holo-Pendant</b>:  Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum.

<b>Finn</b>:  What the—? [<i>The hologram of Princess appear immediately</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum [<i>Hologram</i>]</b>:  Hey, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>shrieks</i>] [<i>falls on his back</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum [<i>Hologram</i>]</b>:  I'm just checking in using the holo-pendant. How are my tarts doing?

<b>Finn</b>:  They're, um... th-they're—

<b>Jake</b>:  They're radical! No tart problems here!

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhh, yeah! Right! Everything's, uh—bazoobs! Oh, look, something is eclipsing the sun. It's so dark now. [<i>Save the Holo-pendant in his hat </i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum [<i>Hologram</i>]</b>:  Finn? Finn! Oh, well, I'll see you soon enough!

<b>Holo-Pendant</b>:  Transmission complete.

<b>Jake</b>:  I think the plan went awry.

<b>Finn</b>:  No! All this was just some freak bad luck, but we still got some tarts and the princess is still safe.

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, yeah, and who knows what kind of freaky things would have happened if we took the Royal Tart Path? [<i>Finn puts on the tart pack</i>] Heheh, old Cinnamon Bun's probably got his hands full.

[<i>The scene changes to the Cinnamon Bun on the Royal Tart Path</i>]

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>:  Bye! Goodbye! Bye-bye!

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 1</b>:  Hello!

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Hello!

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 1</b>:  Shall I hold that for you, sir?

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>:  Okay. [<i>whistles and gives the container to the Guard</i>]

[<i>They approach another guard</i>]

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 2</b>:  Shall I hold that for you, sir?

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 1</b>:  Okay.

[<i>Several guards in a row help as Cinnamon Bun continues whistling</i>]

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 3</b>:  Shall I hold that for you, sir?

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 2</b>:  Okay.

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 4</b>:  Shall I hold that for you, sir?

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 3</b>:  Okay.

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 5</b>:  Shall I hold that for you, sir?

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 4</b>:  Okay.

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 6</b>:  Shall I hold that for you, sir?

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 5</b>:  Okay.

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 7</b>:  Shall I hold that for you, sir?

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 6</b>:  Okay.

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 8</b>:  Shall I hold that for you, sir?

<b>Royal Tart Path Guard 7</b>:  Okay.

[<i>The scene changes to the Bad Lands</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  You know what? Even though it totally wasn't our fault, it's probably for the best that we lost those tarts. [<i>They enter a giant skull of an animal</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Huh? How?

<b>Finn</b>:  Well, it's like a reminder to really stay sharp and play it extra safe.

[<i>They leave the skull</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  For instance, take this scary cavern, here. No sane person would ever bring a tart down there. So...

<b>Jake</b>:  So no thieves!

<b>Finn</b>:  Exactly.

<b>Jake</b>:  You are on a roll today, buddy!

[<i>They enter the cave</i>]

[<i>The scene inside the cave, everything is completely dark, only you can see the eyes of the characters who move through it</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  P.U.!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, P.U.!

[<i>A deep sniff is heard</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah?

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, man, did you just, like, sniff my butt?

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh, just now?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah.

<b>Jake</b>:  No.

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh. Alright.

[<i>They keep walking, and Jake hums a tune</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmm. Hey, Finn?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  Did you just, uh, lick me—all the way up my arm?

<b>Finn</b>:  No.

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmm. Strange.

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, let me see those matches.

[<i>Finn lights a match and they realize they are surrounded by <a href="/wiki/Chud" title="Chud">Chuds</a></i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>scream</i>]

[<i>The scene goes black while Finn and Jake scream and fighting noises are heard. They get thrown out of the cave.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh-oh! Man, we got got! There's only two left!

<b>Finn</b>:  What?!

<b>Holo-Pendant</b>:  Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum.

<b>Finn</b>:  Aaaaah!

[<i>Finn throws the Holo-Pendant</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum [<i>Hologram</i>]</b>:  Hello?

<b>Finn</b>:  We blew it, man! My plan sucked—it sucked all along—but I was blinded by my hubris! Now PB is gonna get got, and it's all my fault!

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa, whoa, take it easy, buddy. We've still got two whole tarts left. PB is gonna be fine.

[<i><a href="/wiki/Butterfly_With_Laser_Gun" title="Butterfly With Laser Gun">A butterfly</a> lands on the tart pack</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  You really think so?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, why not?

<b>Butterfly</b>:  Hey! Keep off them tarts!

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh?

<b>Butterfly Bandit</b>:  I said back off of them tarts! Are you an imbecile?!

<b>Finn</b>:  But I—

<b>Bandit Butterfly</b>:  Right the bazoobs now! [<i>Pulls out his laser gun</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn, he's got a laser gun!

[<i>The butterfly shoots, and Finn &amp; Jake move away</i>]

<b>Bandit Butterfly</b>:  Yeah! That's it. Alright, [<i>Grabs the tart pack and flies off</i>] now I gotta book it to Nana's for brunch! See youse later!

<b>Finn</b>:  It's over. PB's gonna get croaked.

<b>Jake</b>:  Mmm, yeah—or... we could smash in there and stop Congress from chopping her head off.

<b>Finn</b>:  You're right! Jake, let's go save Princess Bubblegum!

[<i>The scene changes to the Royal Congressional Hall</i>]

[<i>Finn and Jake enter</i>]

<b>Backrubbers</b>:  Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop!

[<i>Finn and Jake see Princess Bubblegum bring her face to the table while a Backrubber raises his axe. Finn's eyes go big in terror.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  NOOOOO!!!!

[<i>The guy with the ax makes the cut</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Aaaaah! ... Huh?

[<i>The ax is revealed to have merely chopped a tart</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Another perfectly chopped tart!

[<i>The crowd cheers and Princess Bubblegum takes a picture</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Let the annual Back-Rubbing Ceremony begin!

<b>Finn</b>:  Dude, they were just slicing tarts!

<b>Jake</b>:  And there's Cinnamon Bun over there!

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>:  Hey!

<b>Finn</b>:  He must have delivered the decoys...

[<i>Pause</i>]

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  the ones we poisoned!

[<i>The princess is about to eat a tart</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Nooo!

[<i>Finn slaps the tart away</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Princess, don't eat that tart!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Okay! Jeez, Finn, I won't eat that tart. I'll eat this other tart instead!

[<i>She stuffs it in her mouth</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  No, Princess, no!

[<i>She becomes immobilized</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  The princess has been paralyzed!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  I'm not paralyzed! I'm gripped with the <i>flavor</i>!

<b>Finn</b>:  That means we must have been carrying the poisoned tarts all along!

[<i>The Butterfly bandit is shown with a tart, falling through the sky, paralyzed.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Yep! All part of my master plan.

<b>Jake</b>:  Psht! Whatever, man. Heh heh.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Excuse me! What is this about poisoned tarts and alternate plans?

<b>Finn</b>:  I-I—alright, here it comes. [<i>blushes</i>] I had a brilliant plan to tote the tarts along a dangerous path, but I mucked it up. [<i>sighs</i>] You oughtta give this toter job to Cinnamon Bun. He's the real hero.

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>:  [<i>laughs</i>] Yeah! [<i>He does a flip into the punch bowl</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm sorry for not following your instructions and for lying to you about it.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Oh, Finn, I forgive you—'cause I lied to you, too! They weren't going to decapitate me; I just said that so you guys wouldn't eat the tarts!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  So I guess we're even.

[<i>She hugs Finn, and he blushes.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhh, yeah, I guess so.

[<i>The Royal Tart Toter bursts in, holding a squirrel and a hen</i>]

<b>Royal Tart Toter</b>:  Ladies and gentlemen! The Royal Tarts have arrived.

<b>Backrubbers</b>:  [<i>gasp</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  The old Tart Toter! [<i>whispering</i>] Nobody move! He can't see or hear, but he can feel your movement.

<b>Royal Tart Toter</b>:  Hello? Eat my tarts? This cosmic dance of bursting decadence and withheld permissions twists all our arms collectively, but if sweetness can win—and it can—[<i>The background changes to the Galaxy of Flavors with <a href="/wiki/Lumpy_Space_Princess" title="Lumpy Space Princess">Lumpy Space Princess</a> passing by</i>] then I'll still be here tomorrow, to high-five you yesterday, my friends. Peace.

[<i>Lumpy Space Princess grabs a passing donut, while the Royal Tart Toter drifts into the distance</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Sheesh!
