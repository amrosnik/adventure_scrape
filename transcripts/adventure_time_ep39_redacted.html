<b>Goblins</b>:  Yeah, yeah! [<i>Background: "You should do it!"</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, be their king.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, man, I'm an adventurer for life.

<b>Goblin with Cane</b>:  If there isn't a king to not tell me to not start a riot, I could start a riot, then!

<b>Goblin</b>:  No rules, baby! Start that riot!

<b>Goblins</b>:  Whoo! Yeah! [<i>Starts riot </i>]

<b>Goblin</b>:  Flip this table!

<b>Finn</b>:  Hahaha, yeah!

<b>Gummy</b>:  The Goblin Birthing Pits, Your Majesties.

<b>Goblin in the Pit</b>:  I'm being... born.

<b>Finn</b>:  That's pretty neat.

<b>Gummy</b>:  The Garden of Living Fountains.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  Whoo! Awesome.

<b>Gummy</b>:  The Royal Game Archive, complete with controller hats.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Wearing controller hats</i>] Ooooh.

<b>Gummy</b>:  The Royal Dragon Stables.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>thinks about riding a dragon and saying, Ohhhhh! Hahaha!</i>] Whoa!

<b>Gummy</b>:  And finally, the royal bedroom, with king-sized bed for the royal couple.

<b>Jake</b>:  Can you make that a bunk bed?

<b>Gummy</b>:  Yes, my queen. Whisper Dan. [<i>Claps</i>]

<b>Whisper Dan</b>:  [<i>Cranks a wheel, which in turn cuts the bed in half with a giant knife. Some hands spring out of the wall to hold the top half above the bottom half.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  I call top. [<i>jumps on top</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  And I call...

<b>Gummy</b>:  Wait! For you, great king, the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Royal_Rules" title="Book of Royal Rules">Book of Royal Rules</a>. [<i>holding a book with lots of pages</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmmm. Sounds boring.

<b>Gummy</b>:  Oh, no worries, my Liege. I'll read it <i>to</i> you.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, Jake, want to stay awake and hear some rules?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Immediately falls asleep. A lion and a goose sleep with him.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Alright, lay it on me, Gummy.

<b>Gummy</b>:  Introduction, colon, the 623 royal rules were established in moon year 16, in response to Elder Gorflox's repeated requests for an organized... [<i>Finn falls asleep and two black and white tigers cover him as blankets</i>] Awaken, Your Highness!

<b>Jake</b>:  No way, dude. [<i>rolls over and farts, waking the lion</i>]

<b>Gummy</b>:  Your Excellency! Let's go. We have much to do! 

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoo!!

<b>Gummy</b>:  [<i>Leads Finn to another room</i>] This is where you may perform your daily processes, my king [<i>opens the door</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoooaa!!!! Look at that huge mirror... and it's painted baby blue—boy style.

<b>Gummy</b>:  Come, sire, it is time to brush your teeth in the front of the "boy style" mirror. [<i>clapping</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Whooo!!! Awesome! [<i>takes the toothbrush</i>]

<b>Goblins around the sink</b>:  [<i>gasp</i>] Oh, no, no, no, Your Majesty! Let us brush your teeth

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Does a back flip</i>] Yaaaah!! Whoa, ease up, dudes. Finn access only.

<b>One goblin around the sink</b>:  Aaaah, he's a rule breaker! Don't spank us too hard. [<i>bend over so Finn can spank them</i>]

<b>Gummy</b>:  Spare them, Your Majesty! Spank me instead! [<i>bends over</i>] Set my buttocks ablaze!

<b>Finn</b>:  Guys, what are you talking about?

<b>Gummy</b>:  Rule 1: The king shall not brush his own teeth... in the book of royal rules I read to you last night.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh! Oh. Guys, put your hams away.

<b>All three goblins</b>:  Whaa??

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm not gonna spank your hams. I'm not that kind of king!

<b>Gummy</b>:  So then... we <i>may</i> brush your teeth, my lord?

<b>Finn</b>:  You can brush my teeth... I guess.

<b>All 3 goblins</b>:  Yaayyyy!!!!!! [<i>Put 3 toothbrushes in his mouth and cuts to another scene</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  This brunch looks great! Can't wait to dig in. [<i>about to cut it</i>]

<b>Gummy</b>:  Uhhh, I will cut that, Your Highness.

<b>Finn</b>:  Gummy, as king, I order you to let me cut it.

<b>Gummy</b>:  I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm cutting it, Gummy! [<i>about to cut it</i>]

<b>Gummy</b>:  No! [<i>takes them away and cuts it</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>annoyed</i>] Thank you, Gummy.

<b>Gummy</b>:  Uhhhhh, a thousand pardons, my lord. You're not going to chew that, are you?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah.

<b>Gummy</b>:  I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it.

<b>Finn</b>:  Gummy, just let me do this. No one will know.

<b>Gummy</b>:  I would know. [<i>takes it off his fork, chews it up, and spits it out on Finn's plate</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhhhhhh, Jake, this is nuts.

<b>Jake</b>:  Maybe, but rules are rules. [<i>a goblin spits stuff out on Jake's plate</i>]

<b>Gummy</b>:  Master, eat your food. I chewed thoroughly and heated it to goblin body temperature.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm not hungry, Gummy.

<b>Gummy</b>:  You look a little bit down. Would you like me to weep for you?

<b>Finn</b>:  No, Gummy. It's just.... [<i>the door burst open a goblin came in</i>]

<b>Goblin</b>:  Sire, sire!!!! There's trouble in town square. A thief!!

<b>Finn</b>:  A thief? Hahaha, yes! I'll handle it! [<i>takes out his sword</i>]

<b>Gummy</b>:  No, sire! The king is not allowed to fight. He must give a <i>speech</i> to the thief. That is the royal rule, my Liege. [<i>Finn frowns and they go out on a balcony</i>] There's the thief! [<i>a guy trying to take a basket from an old lady goblin</i>]

<b>Thief</b>:  Give me them hot buns, lady!

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, thief!

<b>A goblin</b>:  It's the new king. It's him! [<i>everyone looks at him</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I got a speech for you—

<b>Gummy</b>:  Nooooooo! [<i>covers Finns mouth</i>] The Royal Speaker must give the speech.

<b>Finn</b>:  What.

<b>Gummy</b>:  Ya see? [<i>the royal speaker comes out on a balcony above them</i>]

<b>Royal Speech-taker</b>:  [<i>Clears throat</i>] Since the dawn of time, the balance of what is right and what is wrong has...

<b>Thief</b>:  [<i>looks back at old lady goblin and tries to get it again</i>] Ha ha ha, I'll take this.

<b>Gummy</b>:  Yes, you can feel it slowly working, eh?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>starts to get mad and takes out his sword</i>] I can't let this go on. [<i>jumps off and gets the basket</i>] Hands off, thief!!

<b>Thief</b>:  [<i>gasps and backs away</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ha!! Here you go, old lady. [<i>gives her the basket</i>]

<b>Old lady</b>:  Oh, no, the new king! Just as cruel as the last king.

<b>Finn</b>:  I—you—what?

<b>Another goblin</b>:  Oh, king, we beg you not to slay the old lady. [<i>Finn turns around</i>] Aaaah!!! [<i>goblins murmur in fear</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  No, wait.

<b>Old lady</b>:  Don't slay me! You may keep the hot buns, Your Majesty! [<i>on the ground</i>]

<b>Another goblin</b>:  I'm ready for my spanking, Mr. Xergiok part two.

<b>Rest of group</b>:  We're ready [<i>bending over for their spanking</i>] for our spankings, sire.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] ♪I just want to help y'all as much as I can, and y'all just keep showing me your goblin hams. [<i>rides on a goblin</i>] When I became king, I didn't think y'all would show me your rears, but I'll accept my boring fate, and shed this tear... [<i>wipes off tear</i>] 'cause I can't seem to cure you of your groundless fears.♪

<b>Gummy</b>:  No. No more spankings... [<i>Finn enters</i>] Aaaahh!!!!

<b>Finn</b>:  Gummy, don't be afraid. I'm gonna stick to the rules now, okay?

<b>Gummy</b>:  My lord, I'm sorry, y-you haven't heard? Xergiok is returning with an evil army. Come look through the scope! [<i>Finn gets off the goblin he was riding</i>] You see? [<i>he sees an army of Earclopses led by Xergiok</i>]

<b>Xergiok</b>:  Prepare to destroy them all!

<b>Gummy</b>:  [<i>passes out</i>] Ohhh...

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>looks through the telescope and gasps</i>] If I defeat Xergiok as king, I can prove to the goblins that an active king can be a good king, but I can't let them know until it's all over. Stay fainted, Gummy. [<i>goes out door</i>] Ooooooooh! Whisper Dan, have you seen Jake?

<b>Whisper Dan</b>:  [<i>cranks a wheel, opening a hatch</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm in here.

<b>Finn</b>:  Xergiok's back with an army of Earclopses. Let's bust them up.

<b>Jake</b>:  pbbbbbbbbbbbbb. All right, man, how do we do this?

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmmmmmmm. [<i>looks at Whisper Dan</i>]

[<i>They start running.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  What if they figure it out?

<b>Finn</b>:  No way, man.

[<i>Back at the castle they put a box over Whisper Dan's head to make him look like Finn.</i>]

<b>Gummy</b>:  I'm going to be honest with you, king Finn. When I'm scared, I feel most safe in your lap.

[<i>Meanwhile, Finn and Jake join the goblin soldiers facing the army of Earclopses</i>]

<b>Xergiok</b>:  Line up for you spankings, goblins! [<i>the goblins get scared</i>]

<b>One goblin</b>:  Ohhhhh, too late—in my pants.

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, the goblins can't see me being unkingly. I need a disguise.

<b>Jake</b>:  Jump in my mouth. [<i>Finn does so and Jake makes Jakesuit</i>]

<b>Xergiok</b>:  Who among you has the courage to face Xergiok?

<b>Finn</b>:  Shut your kissin' hole, Xergiok! It's time for a beatin'.

<b>Xergiok</b>:  I salute you, foolish warrior! You can be my personal sla—[<i>Finn in Jakesuit claps in the Earclops' ear, and the Earclops lands on Xergiok. Finn claps in more Earclopses' ears, causing them to fall.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>into megaphone</i>] wowowowowowowowowoowowoow! [<i>the other Earclopses fall down from the loud sound</i>]

<b>Xergiok</b>:  How in the world? [<i>Jakesuit gets in front of Xergiok</i>]

Finn: Dude, no one uses Earclopses in a battle without earplugs.

<b>Xergiok</b>:  [<i>does vanishing spell and appears above them</i>] Eat this! [<i>Throws a fireball at them. Finn hits it away with his sword, which hits a rock. Xergiok shoots three more fireballs; two miss, but one Finn hits with his sword, which almost hits Xergiok</i>] Whoa! [<i>teleports in front of them</i>] Ha ha, you missed me— [<i>the fireball hits him; he drops his wand, which Finn picks up and eats</i>]

<b>Goblins</b>:  [<i>cheering</i>] [<i>they pick up Finn and Jake and take them into the castle</i>]

<b>Gummy</b>:  Oh, great king, with the help of a brave soldier, you thwarted the evil Xergiok. [<i>a goblin raises Whisper Dan's hand</i>]

<b>Goblins</b>:  Hurrah!!! [<i>the goblin raises and lowers Whisper Dan's arm</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  C'mon, dude, lets get out of here.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] Alright. [<i>they walk home</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Well, looks like they got the king they wanted, buddy.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yep.

<b>Finn</b>:  And we're going home to adventure.

<b>Jake</b>:  Mmhmm.

<b>Finn</b>:  High five us, dude. [<i>Finn does one hand and Jake does the other hand and they clap together</i>] Hey, Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  Wha?

<b>Finn</b>:  Why do the insides of you smell like vanilla?

<b>Jake</b>:  Ohh, uh, a wizard put a curse on me.

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh, neat.
