[<i>Toronto is holding a sword. Finn rubs a cut on his head.</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: And I dub thee Sir <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a> the Dog.

[<i>Toronto lightly taps Jake's shoulder with sword.</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: You two now comprise the royal guard of the one true princess of Ooo. That's me! [<i>winks</i>] As such, you may no longer own property or operate children and must render all treasure and wives unto your sworn princess within a hangman's fortnight.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>scoffs</i>] Joke's on you, man. We spent all our treasure the other day. Plus, don't even have any wives.

<b>Finn</b>: Wait, what? What about <a href="/wiki/Lady_Rainicorn" title="Lady Rainicorn">Lady</a>?

<b>Jake</b>: Lady's my girlfriend.

<b>Finn</b>: Wait, but...

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, yeah.

<b>King of Ooo</b>: We, the inhabitants of <a href="/wiki/Land_of_Ooo" title="Land of Ooo">Ooo</a>, owe you heroes our very lives.

<b>Finn</b>: Uh...

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Come on. Guess!

<b>Finn</b>: Um... Fight aâ€”Fight a <a href="/wiki/Dragons" title="Dragons">dragon</a>?

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Wrong! Follow me.

[<i>Finn, Jake, the King of Ooo, and Toronto go to the highest part of the sweet castle</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Man, this is stupid as heck. I miss PB.

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, yes... [<i>panting</i>] I mean, except for this sweet armor, though. This armor is hot like fire.
