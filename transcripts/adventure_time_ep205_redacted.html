[<i>The sun begins to rise over the mountains. Its light reaches the village and creeps toward <a href="/wiki/Marceline" title="Marceline">Marceline</a>.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>: Marceline, no!

<b>Marceline</b>: Don't let anyone read my diaries! Burn them, Finn! They're embarrassi—! [<i>screams</i>]

[<i>Marceline is bathed in sunlight. The screen goes white, and a flashback begins. A young Marceline sits on her mother's lap in an RV.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Marceline%27s_mom" title="Marceline's mom" class="mw-redirect">Marceline's mom</a></b>: And then he said, "Fine." That's the story of how I met your <a href="/wiki/Hunson_Abadeer" title="Hunson Abadeer">dad</a>.

<b>Marceline</b>: Can I play now?

<b>Marceline's mom</b>: No, Marceline, Sweetie. It's nap time.

<b>Marceline</b>: But I don't want to sleep! My dreams are weird.

<b>Marceline's mom</b>: All dreams are weird.

<b>Marceline</b>: But, Mom, my dreams are we-e-e-eird.

<b>Marceline's mom</b>: [<i>chuckles</i>] Honey, something weird might just be something familiar viewed from a different angle. And that's not scary, right?

[<i>She and Marceline embrace and sing "<a href="/wiki/Everything_Stays_(song)" title="Everything Stays (song)">Everything Stays</a>." The screen fades out, then returns to show Marceline a little older and packing a sled. Snow falls in a ruined city.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Ice_King" title="Ice King">Simon</a></b>: [<i>voiceover</i>] Hello, Marci. I don't know if you'll ever hear this message. I fear my thoughts are no longer my own. Just watch over me...

[<i>Marceline looks over to see Simon recording himself.</i>]

<b>Simon</b>: ...until I can find my way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity. And then maybe, <a href="/wiki/Betty" title="Betty" class="mw-redirect">Betty</a>, my princess—maybe you will love me again. [<i>sighs</i>] Please love me again, Betty! [<i>sobs</i>] Okay, bye! [<i>takes out tape and pushes over camera</i>] [<i>sighs</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Hey, Simon. I, uh, finished packing your gear. So can I have my tape now?

<b>Simon</b>: What? No. This is private, silly. [<i>tucks tape into bag on sled</i>] There you go. Snug as a bug.

<b>Marceline</b>: Seriously, Simon. Please don't go.

<b>Simon</b>: I... I have to protect you.

<b>Marceline</b>: How can you protect me if you're not even here?!

<b>Simon</b>: I'll arrange for someone to come take care of you. I'll make sure he doesn't leave.

<b>Marceline</b>: Please, Simon, I could help you with this.

<b>Simon</b>: Yeah, maybe one day you will. But until then, you have to stay brave, my fearless Marceline.

[<i>Simon touches her cheek as tears escape her eyes. His thumb touches the tear, freezing it. When he moves it, the frozen tear scratches her face.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Ouch!

<b>Simon</b>: You see? I have to go now. Goodbye, Marci. [<i>hops on sled and leaves</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: What? No! [<i>chases after him</i>] Wait! Ugh! [<i>trips and falls in snow</i>] Simon! Simon!
