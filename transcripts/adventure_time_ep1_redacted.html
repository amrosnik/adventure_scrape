<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>bouncing:</i>] Whoop! Huh?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>bouncing:</i>] Whoop!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>floating:</i>] Whoopiiieee...

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Cheers, Lumpy Space Princess.

[<i>Everyone cheers.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Bouncing!

<b>Finn</b>:  Princess, this tea party sucks in a big way! But thanks for the invite!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Oh, don't worry, Finn. The Mallow Tea Ceremony takes years to master.

<b>Finn</b>:  Princess! I think I just now mastered it! [<i>Tea splashes in his face.</i>] One more bounce. [<i>Bounces down</i>] Alright! [<i>Hits the ground</i>] Unh! Tea partying's hard, huh, Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Hits the ground</i>] Oof! Yes!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  What?! No way! It's super easy!

<b>Finn</b>:  Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker! You're floating, not bouncing!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Fine. I'll prove it. [<i>She stops floating</i>] Huh? Ah! Oh, no! [<i>Bounces down</i>] Oh, snap! [<i>She lands with her teeth on Jake's leg.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  AAAAAGH!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Muffled:</i>] Oh. Sorry I bit your leg.

<b>Jake</b>:  You're still biting me!!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry.

<b>Finn</b>:  Dude! Your leg!

<b>Jake</b>:  This is... new. It's nothin' ominous, though. Just a bump.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Nah, that's no bump. It's the early stage of <a href="/wiki/The_lumps" title="The lumps">the lumps</a>.

<b>Finn</b>:  Is it serious?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  It just means he's changing into a Lumpy Space guy, on account of my bite. It's just like, um, y'know... werewolf rules? [<i>Imitating a werewolf</i>] Ar, rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, no!

<b>Jake</b>:  What? You think I'm gonna turn all lumpy like her? Get outta here. [<i>Arm suddenly lumps up</i>] Wha? Finn, I think I'm freakin' out!

<b>Finn</b>:  Calm down, bud! I'll... I'll sock the lumpiness outta ya!

[<i>Teacup falls on the ground and shatters.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Hey, now! [<i>Bouncing down</i>] Royal intervention! Surely there must be an antidote to the lumps.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Yeah. There's an antidote, but you have to go all the way to <a href="/wiki/Lumpy_Space" title="Lumpy Space">Lumpy Space</a> to get it. And Jake has to use it by sunset.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  What happens if he doesn't take the antidote by sunset?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  He'll be lumpy, like, forever.

<b>Finn</b>:  LSP, please! Can you tell us how to reach Lumpy Space?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Yeah, I mean, there's a portal nearby. I can show you whenever.

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  [<i>Exiting with Lumpy Space Princess</i>] Take us now! Take us now!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Intestines grumble</i>] I should not have drunk that much tea! [<i>Runs off</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Don't go telling everyone about this portal or whatever. It's kind of a secret.

[<i>Finn and Jake look around.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Where is it?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Portal's that <a href="/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">Frog</a> and mushroom.

[<i>Frog jumps on mushroom with a ribbit.</i>]

<b>Frog</b>:  Password, please.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>yells</i>] Whatevers2009!!

<b>Frog</b>:  Good day, Princess. Is your father okay with you entering Lumpy Space with two... [<i>puffs out his chest</i>] non-Lumpers?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Whispering to Lumpy Space Princess</i>] Just say yes! Yes, yes, yes!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Yeah, whatever, fine.

[<i>The frog extends its tongue to the three and sucks them into his mouth, transporting them to Lumpy Space.</i>]

[<i>Scene changes to Lumpy Space. Finn is thrown toward a lumpy cloud where LSP and Jake are waiting for him.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  AAAAH!! Whoa... Lumpy Space. So, where's the antidote?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Hold it. First, you should check out my house. It's, like, kind of lame, but way less lame than, like, your house.

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh, could you skip to the part where you tell us where the antidote is?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  It's up there at <a href="/wiki/Lumpy_Space#Makeout_Point" title="Lumpy Space">Makeout Point</a>.

<b>Finn</b>:  That's so close! We can run there in no... [<i>Camera pans up, revealing that Makeout Point is across an abyss.</i>] ...time. Aww, what?!! It's, like, a million-mile fall into space!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Yeah. You have to travel by car in my world, or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss.

<b>Lumpy Space King</b>:  Daughter!! Have you brought smooth people into our domain?!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  I had to, <a href="/wiki/Lumpy_Space_King" title="Lumpy Space King" class="mw-redirect">Dad</a>... I'm trying to help them, so don't lumping yell at me!

<b>Lumpy Space Queen</b>:  WHAT DID YOU SAY?! What did you just say?!?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  I SAID, "LUMP OFF," MOM!!! [<i>yells gibberish angrily, then pants heavily</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh...

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>To Finn:</i>] WHAT?!?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Vroom vroom??

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh, yeah. [<i>To parents:</i>] I need to borrow the car.

<b>Lumpy Space King</b>:  You have made your mother cry for the last time, daughter! You are hereby banned from using the royal car!! [<i>walks inside house and slams the door</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Shucks! I lumping hate them! I'm really, really sorry, Finn. But I can't help you because my parents are horrible idiots.

<b>Finn</b>:  Don't you know anyone else with a car?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  My friend <a href="/wiki/Melissa" title="Melissa">Melissa</a> has a car. But she's dating my ex-boyfriend <a href="/wiki/Brad" title="Brad">Brad</a>.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>frustrated</i>] Call her NOW.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Hmm. [<i>pulls out cellphone</i>] [<i>LSP says to her phone:</i>] Call BFF 66.

[<i>Elsewhere, Melissa's phone rings.</i>]

<b>Melissa</b>:  [<i>answering</i>] Hello?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Hey, Melissa. What's up?

<b>Finn</b>:  What's she saying?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>whispering to Finn</i>] I'm asking her, jeez! Melissa, just listen!

<b>Melissa</b>:  Have you forgotten what day it is?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Melissa. I'm trying to help out some friends.

<b>Melissa</b>:  Tonight is the weekly <a href="/wiki/Promcoming" title="Promcoming">Promcoming Dance</a>!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh, Glob. I forgot.

<b>Finn</b>:  What'd she say?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance! [<i>To Melissa, in excitement:</i>] It's gonna be so flipping awesome!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>exasperated</i>] LSP, we don't have time for this. Ask for the ride, LSP.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh—[<i>Finn takes the cellphone</i>] [<i>LSP continues to say oh a couple of times until she realizes her phone is missing</i>] Wha?!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To Melissa, imitating Lumpy Space Princess:</i>] Melissa, [<i>Lumpy Space Princess tries to retrieve her phone while Finn continues.</i>] you should totally drive us to Makeout Point to make out with hot boys!

<b>Melissa</b>:  LSP, you're so baaaaad... be there in a sec!

<b>Finn</b>:  Biyah. [<i>hangs up</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Hmm. [<i>takes phone back</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Normal voice:</i>] Sorry. But Jake's lumpiness is worsening!

<b>Jake</b>:  Actually, I think I'm beating it back with sheer willpower! [<i>Part of his head bulges up.</i>] [<i>flatly:</i>] Oh, my. [<i>Forces lump back into body</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Yeah, whatever. Just don't mess with my phone again.

[<i>Melissa arrives on her car.</i>]

<b>Melissa</b>:  Hi!

[<i>Melissa drives into Finn, knocking him over.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ugh... OKAY! Let's go, let's go, let's go!!

[<i>They ride off, and Melissa's "SXY-LMP" liscense plate is revealed. Electronic music plays.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right? [<i>suddenly in a lumpy accent:</i>] Ah. I love this song. We should totally TP Shandala's house! [<i>in normal voice:</i>] Gracious! That was terrible! Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps... if I do turn... if I become lumpy like them, I want you to—

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>while embracing Jake:</i>] It's not gonna come to that. But if it does, I'll bury you beneath the nicest, most shadiest tree!

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm saying that if I go totally lumpy, then I want you to get used to lumpy Jake. What did you think I was sayin'?

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, um... [<i>awkwardly</i>] Heh heh. [<i>angrily towards Melissa:</i>] CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?!

<b>Melissa</b>:  We're already here! Hi, Finn.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  We've been here for, like, five minutes.

<b>Finn</b>:  Finally! Huh? This doesn't look like Makeout Point.

<b>Melissa</b>:  This is Brad's house. You wanted a ride to Makeout Point? You think I want to make out with you?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh...

<b>Melissa</b>:  [<i>blushing</i>] Well, maybe I do, but... wait. [<i>angrily:</i>] I HAVE A BOYFRIEND, FINN!! [<i>throws Finn down</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  LSP, we gotta hurry! Jake's running out of time!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Hey. This is hard for me, too. I mean, I used to eat chili cheese fries with Brad... so there's gonna be a lot of romantic tension on this ride!

<b>Brad</b>:  Hey.

<b>Melissa</b>:  Oh, Braaaaad... [<i>giggles</i>]

<b>Brad</b>:  You miss me yet, LSP?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>sullenly:</i>] Scooch over, Finn. I'm gonna sit in the back.

[<i>Scene changes to when they arrive at Makeout Point</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  This is it.

[<i>Melissa parks the car.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Let's go!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Wait. Watch yourself, Finn. The guys who use the antidote up here are notorious for being... [<i>whispering:</i>] smooth posers.

<b>Finn</b>:  What does that mean?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  It just means what it means. Hurry. Get the antidote so we can get outta here.

<b>Finn</b>:  Thanks, LSP.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  BUUUUMPS.

<b>Jake</b>:  Um... bumps.

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh, yeah, bumps.

[<i>Jake's skin bulges up more.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Aw, man!

[<i>They hurry over and come to three Lumpy Space People, <a href="/wiki/Glasses" title="Glasses">Glasses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Monty" title="Monty">Monty</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lenny" title="Lenny">Lenny</a>.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, guys. Lookin' smooth!

<b>Glasses</b>:  Really? You think we're smooth?

<b>Finn</b>:  Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah!

<b>Monty</b>:  Why are you sucking up to us?

<b>Finn</b>:  My best friend needs an antidote for lumpiness.

<b>Lenny</b>:  Chyah, lumpiness suuucks. Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere-hog! [<i>Lenny pushes Monty off an sphere he was sitting on. Monty becomes lumpy.</i>] My turn! [<i>Lenny sits on the sphere and becomes smooth.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  So the antidote is in that orb you were sitting on!

<b>Lenny</b>:  This orb is the antidote, bruh.

<b>Finn</b>:  Can my friend borrow it?

<b>Lenny</b>:  Yeah, sure, as long as you give it right back. [<i>Tosses Finn the sphere and becomes lumpy</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hammacow. Thanks, fellas.

[<i>Lumpy Space Princess enters.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  What's taking so long? Did those smooth-heads give you the orb already, or what?

[<i>Lenny takes the sphere back.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait!!

<b>Lenny</b>:  Is this another friend of yours?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  What do you care? Just give 'em the antidote already, and stop being such a poser.

<b>Monty</b>:  Sorry, kid. [<i>exiting with Lenny and Glasses:</i>] We changed our minds.

<b>Finn</b>:  Why did you have to say all those rude things to them?!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  What? I was helping you.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>sarcastically:</i>] Thanks a lot! [<i>sincerely:</i>] They were right about to hand over the antidote!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>bitterly:</i>] You're welcome a lot.

<b>Finn</b>:  You insulted them! And they got mad! And now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever! This is all your fault!!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Wow. Now I know how you really feel. I was just trying to help, but whatever. [<i>raising her voice:</i>] No. No, not whatever! I know I mess things up sometimes, but I'm really trying! And you're supposed to be my friend! [<i>tearing up</i>] Not like the fake ones I have here! So do what you want! I'm going to Promcoming! Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  No. Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me! [<i>Completely transforms into a Lumpy Space person.</i>] Oh, yah. Right behind ya. Just gotta turn my back on this guy. [<i>Literally does so then exits</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  JAKE! IT'S ALMOST SUNSET!! [<i>to himself:</i>] Jake... I didn't save him... I... [<i>Yells wildly and angrily and then punches the ground repeatedly.</i>] I'LL KILL YOU, LUMPY SPAAAAAACE!!

<b>Monty</b>:  Jam on, man!

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh? I thought you guys left!

<b>Monty</b>:  We were drawn back by your plaintive wail. We dig your directionless fury.

<b>Finn</b>:  Um, thanks.

<b>Monty</b>:  Respect. Here. [<i>Tosses Finn the sphere.</i>] Take it. Win your girl back!

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, there's no girl. But there is still time to save Jake! Do you guys know where Promcoming is?

<b>Monty</b>:  Promcoming takes place way down on that land-lump.

<b>Finn</b>:  Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels?

<b>Monty</b>:  Nah. We were all ditched here just like you.

<b>Finn</b>:  Well... you think I can make it to that land-lump if I jumped off this cliff?

<b>Monty</b>:  You kidding?! A smoothie like you will plummet right into the eternal void!

<b>Finn</b>:  What if I was lumpy? Could I float over?

<b>Lenny</b>:  No, no! It's too dangerous!

<b>Glasses</b>:  I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of you making it!

<b>Finn</b>:  That's good enough for me. Now bite me!!

[<i>The three respond in disbelief all at once, then Finn forces them to bite him.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>turning lumpy exceedingly quickly:</i>] Yes! I can feel the multiple bites accelerating the lumpification process! I'm starting to float!

<b>Lenny</b>:  Don't jump, guy!!

<b>Finn</b>:  I have to! For my buddy. [<i>Jumps.</i>] RAAAAAAGH!!!!

<b>Glasses</b>:  Wow. He's insane.

[<i>Finn successfully lands through the roof of Promcoming.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ah, I made it! And there he is!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah! Promcoming! Yeah! Cool!

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake! I'm mostly lumpy now! And I totally think you should sit on this sphere!

<b>Jake</b>:  No!

[<i>Finn tries to force him to sit on it to no avail.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Sit on it!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Slaps sphere down</i>] No!!

<b>Finn</b>:  Please, Jake! You're my best friend! Just sit on the sphere!

<b>Jake</b>:  Chyah! I remember you! You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser!

<b>Finn</b>:  Sit on it!! Before I turn completely lumpy!!

<b>Jake</b>:  NO!!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, no! I can feel the lumpiness... about to consume me!! [<i>Fully transforms into a Lumpy Space person.</i>] Oh, yah. Being lumpy's the best.

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey. Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy. Take your ball and get outta here.

<b>Finn</b>:  Fine. I don't want you to have it anyway.

<b>Jake</b>:  So I can't have it now, eh?

<b>Finn</b>:  That's right. It's mine.

<b>Jake</b>:  GIMME THAT BALL!!

<b>Finn</b>:  NO! You can't have it!

<b>Jake</b>:  I want it! Give it to me!

<b>Finn</b>:  You want it that bad? Go get it, then!

<b>Jake</b>:  Bumps, bi— [<i>Sits on the sphere and turns back to normal.</i>] [<i>gasps</i>] Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore! Oh, no. Finn buddy! You gotta sit on this!

<b>Finn</b>:  No! You can't make me! Smooth—OOF! [<i>Runs into a muscular Lumpy Space person and gets knocked out.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn! Hey, Finn! Hey, buddy! Finn

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>waking up:</i>] Huh?

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey, dude. We made it.

<b>Finn</b>:  Man... There's something cold under my butt. [<i>Noticing sphere:</i>] Oh! [<i>laughs</i>] The antidote! Just in time, too! LSP, I'm sorry I blew up at you before. I didn't mean it. I was just really stressed out.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  You know, it's fine. You and Jake can make it up to me by dancing this last dance with me.

<b>Finn</b>:  Sounds good to me. Whaddaya say, Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Lumpy voice:</i>] That sounds totally lame.

[<i>Everyone gasps</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Normal voice, laughs</i>] I'm just kidding. Let's dance!

[<i>Everyone resumes dancing and the episode ends</i>]
