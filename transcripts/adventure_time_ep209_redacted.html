<b>Jake</b>: It's a cure-all!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Sorry, guys. There are no cure-alls. Your parents were just burping on you for kicks.

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, yeah, that makes sense. [<i>belches</i>] Oh, sorry, last one.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Huh! [<i>covers nose</i>] What did you eat, Jake?!

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, now! I pride myself in having nice-smelling burps. Just kidding.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Pride... hmm. Do you guys know what "hubris" is?

<b>Finn</b>: It's like an old-timey deity who weighed your deeds on a scale.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No. It means excessive pride or arrogance.

<b><a href="/wiki/Lumpy_Space_Princess" title="Lumpy Space Princess">Lumpy Space Princess</a></b>: That's like you, PB.

<b>Finn</b>: Dude.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No, it's true. I believed in myself so much that I was blind to the possible consequences.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: Don't believe in yourself so much then, Dum-dum.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>tearing up</i>] Now my best friend is dying of poison because of me.

<b>Jake</b>: That ain't true, PB. Marcy took a risk, and you helped her because you're her friend. Real friends take each other to the edge of deathâ€”'cause death is life! Right, Finn?

<b>Finn</b>: Shoot, yeah! I get poisoned all the time just doing the dishes!

<b><a href="/wiki/Peppermint_Butler" title="Peppermint Butler">Peppermint Butler</a></b>: I get poisoned on purpose, for research. I have a poison lab back at the <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum%27s_castle" title="Princess Bubblegum's castle">castle</a>.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Well, let's get our butts over there then! Find The Moon, Finn. We'll work on an antidote. You guys take her back to the poison lab. Maybe we can extract her healing powers.

<b>Finn</b>: Word!

[<i>They run off into the forest.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: Hey, wait! What should I do? You guys? [<i>grunts</i>]

[<i>A stake falls out of her back.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: [<i>shudders and laughs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Moon pearls... We're on her trail.

<b>Jake</b>: Gross!

<b>Finn</b>: I think they're pretty.

<b>Jake</b>: What if they're, like, her boogers... or worse?

<b>Finn</b>: Come on, Jake.

<b>Jake</b>: Ew, ew, ew, ew! Sometimes I think vampires were invented just to torment me.

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa. I don't think so, man. I think you might have a hubrits.

<b>Jake</b>: I'm just saying it's a possibility.

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, look! The moon's pontoon.

<b>Jake</b>: See?! I hate it! What it this, some hut the Moon plopped out of her bod?

<b>Finn</b>: I don't think so. This mummy job looks like it used to belong to that mummy job.

<b>Jake</b>: Still hate it. What's that, pickles? Ew. Yeah, that's her.

[<i>Splat!</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Shouldn't she, like, explode or something?

<b>Finn</b>: She just healted that sword right out of her bod! Let's try frying her up in the sun.

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, yeah.

<b>Finn and Jake</b>: Wow!

<b>Jake</b>: How are we supposed to destroy this stay-fresh creep?

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm. Let's stick with P.B.'s plan and try staking her a bunch of different ways.
