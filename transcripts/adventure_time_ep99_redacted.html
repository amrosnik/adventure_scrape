<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughter</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Laughter</i>] You guys are full of magic air.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] [<i>Farts</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Disgusted</i>] Gross! [<i>Rolls with Jake</i>] [<i>Then slaps Jake</i>] No! [<i>Turns to Flame Princess</i>] Princess? You, okay?

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Looks downed</i>] Yeah... It's just the air smells bad from your magic tricks, and now I feel sad.

They'd really cut through the magic stink.

<b>Jake</b>:  Just go back to the <a href="/wiki/Fire_Kingdom" title="Fire Kingdom">Fire Kingdom</a> and get 'em. Problem solved.

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Sighs</i>] [<i>Then stands up</i>] Then I'll have to see my <a href="/wiki/Flame_King" title="Flame King">dad</a>. I'm still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern. So UNFAIR! [<i>Flame Princess transforms again to her enraged form.</i>] [<i>Screams with anger</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Frightened</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh, we can go get 'em.

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Returns to her normal form.</i>] [<i>Pleasant voice</i>] Really? That would be really nice. [<i>Warns</i>] But don't let my Pops see you. I don't want "His Majesty" thinking I need anything from him.

<b>Flambo</b>:  [<i>Farts</i>]

<b>Finn, Flame Princess, &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Surprised</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  That ain't me.

<b>Flambo</b>:  Oh! [<i>Farts again</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Relieved</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Flambo! [<i>Whispers to Finn</i>] For a second, I thought the princess was farting.

<b>Finn</b>:  Flambo, we need you to cast <a href="/wiki/Flame_Powers" title="Flame Powers">Flame Shield</a> on us.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Tip toe walking towards near the scented candles.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  These candles, must be "They."

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Sniffing the candles</i>] [<i>Whispers</i>] They smell like an old lady's bathroom.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Whispers with anger</i>] Hey! Don't disrespect my lady!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Whispers in reply</i>] I said that as a compliment. Like, it reminds me of grandma. I love my grandma.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Takes the candles and puts them into his backpack.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Sniffs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, come on! We gotta stop those guys from killing Flame Princess's dad!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Opens the door</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Dirt bags! Where'd they go?

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Tip toe walking</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>]

<b>Lesser Flame Guards</b>:  [<i>Looks at the painting</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Concentrating</i>]

<b>Lesser Flame Guards</b>:  [<i>Moves to the right and left while looking at them.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  We must follow the voice

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Opens the air vent</i>] [<i>Uses his stretchy powers to get there and pulls Finn up.</i>] [<i>Then closes the air vent</i>]

<b>Unknown</b>:  To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream...

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Whispers</i>] Which way is the hiss voice coming from?

[<i>Finn and Jake moving forward and turning left</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Falls</i>] Whooaaa.

<b>Theater troupe leader</b>:  Five minutes are closing everyone, five minutes.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Takes two members of the theater troupe to a room.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Picks up a table with food on it</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Runs with disguises on</i>]

<b>Jalapeño pepper</b>:  [<i>Panting</i>] [<i>Then heads to a room</i>] Oh. Psh, actors.

[<i>Moments later, Finn and Jake catch up with the theater troupe</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Lays a hand on a theater troupe member</i>] What's going with the costumes?

<b>Theater troupe member</b>:  [<i>High voice</i>] This is a theater troupe. We're getting rrready to perform for the king. Everyone in the kingdom shall be in attendance. [<i>Lowered voice</i>] Of course, you know all this being fellow actors from the exact same troupe. [<i>Turns around and picks clothes</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Makes a distance with Finn</i>] I have an idea. We'll go on stage, act like two conspirators, you will have one shoe untied, I'll talk with a hiss voice, we'll talk about how we want to kill the king, as we do these, we'll study the faces of the audience, a move of guilty reactions.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Likes it</i>] That's brilliant!

<b>Jake</b>:  Thanks! It's an original idea, by me.

[<i>Moments later, at the stage play, Flame King appears and the lights went low for the play.</i>]

<b>Audience</b>:  [<i>Cheering</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Clears throat</i>] Hey conspirator!

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey co-conspirator!

<b>Finn</b>:  Let's talk about how we're gonna kill the king.

<b>Jake</b>:  Shhhhhh sssssomebody might here our evil plot.

<b>Flame King</b>:  [<i>Not liking it</i>] Man, I am so lost.

<b>Jake</b>:  Psst, the audience.

<b>Suspect</b>:  [<i>Moaning</i>] [<i>Then sneezes</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  You think that's one of them.

<b>Finn</b>:  Maybe, let's keep goin'. So, what are you packin'?

<b>Jake</b>:  Water, man. Enough of it to put out the King's fire.

<b>Suspect</b>:  [<i>Still moaning</i>] [<i>Then eats a hot dog</i>] [<i>Looking around with suspicion</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I thinks he's starting to crack. Water? You know what is more painful, if we pour ice in his ear. That's how we'll kill the Flame King.

<b>Flame King</b>:  [<i>Bored</i>] Psh, kill the Flame King? [<i>Thinks about it</i>] [<i>Then behind him, an arm appeared, holding ice and fails to pour on him.</i>] [<i>Angry reaction</i>] This is treason disguised as a play! [<i>Orders</i>] Guards, seized them!

<b>Flame Guards</b>:  [<i>Approaching Finn and Jake</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What!? No!

<b>Flame Guards</b>:  [<i>Pinning Finn and Jake to the ground</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Grunts</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Please, we were trying to warn you about the assassins!

<b>Flame King</b>:  Hmmmmm, search them!

<b>Audience</b>:  [<i>Disbelief</i>]

<b>Furnius</b>:  Ssssilence!

<b>Flame King</b>:  Wa-wa-wait, wait. That voice. [<i>Orders</i>] Guards, take off their hoods.

<b>Torcho</b>:  Here, my identity!

<b>Furnius</b>:  [<i>Hisses</i>]

<b>Furnius</b>:  Hello Uuuncle!

<b>Audience</b>:  [<i>Shocked and surprised</i>] Wait, what!?

<b>Flame King</b>:  [<i>Orders</i>] Arrest the executioners!

<b>Flame Guards</b>:  [<i>Arrests the executioners</i>]

<b>Flame King</b>:  Hmmmm, [<i>Points right finger at Furnius and Torcho</i>] I thought I had you two extinguished.

<b>Furnius</b>:  You cannot quench the flamessss of revenge!

<b>Torcho</b>:  You snucked on our father to become king!

<b>Flame King</b>:  Oh, yeah! Hehe. [<i>Orders</i>] Take them to the punishment room!

<b>Flame Guards</b>:  [<i>Takes Furnius and Torcho to the punishment room.</i>]

<b>Furnius</b>:  I'll dessstroy all of you, with ice!

<b>Torcho</b>:  Release me!

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait! So, you? You extinguished their dad?

<b>Flame King</b>:  [<i>Yes tone</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  And everyone is evil here?

<b>Flame King</b>:  [<i>Performs a stunt towards the stage</i>]

<b>Flame King</b>:  [<i>Yes tone</i>] All evil.

<b>Finn</b>:  Then, is Flame Princess: evil or maybe chaotic neutral?

<b>Flame King</b>:  She's evil.

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay, so your daughter's evil. We've established that, but do you think if a good guy really liked her, could he, change her to good?

<b>Flame King</b>:  Hmmmmm, well, there'd be penalties to her experience, if she acted out of alignment. But, yes, someone could change her.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Smiles happily</i>]

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>Leaves the stage</i>]

<b>Flame King</b>:  [<i>Thinks about his daughter</i>] Change her to good? [<i>Worried</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts to Flame Princess's house</i>]

[<i>Through window, Finn and Jake look at Flame Princess sleeping.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Aww...

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Breathing</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Picks the scented candles and lights them with Flame Princess's hair</i>] [<i>Then puts them on her bedside table</i>]

[<i>Then suddenly, Flame King appears on the candles.</i>]

<b>Flame King</b>:  [<i>Looks around</i>] Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil.... EVIL!!!

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Wakes up</i>] Aah!

<b>Flame King</b>:  Aah!

<b>Flame Princess</b>:  [<i>Turns around right after what she saw</i>]
