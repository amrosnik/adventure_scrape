<b>Kenneth</b>: Uhh, hello? Hi. Uh, is this the secret mee—[<i>shows a guy sitting on a toilet &amp; reading a magazine</i>]

<b>Candy Person</b>: What errand? What haste?

<b>Kenneth</b>: Uh. Oh, shoot. Oh! "To beelzebub with the brewer's knave!" [<i>the candy person hits a green button, which opens a door behind a urinal, Kenneth goes through it</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Starchie" title="Starchie" class="mw-redirect">Starchie</a></b>: Ahh, Kenneth.

<b>Kenneth</b>: Hey, Starchie.

<b>Starchie</b>: Glad you could make it. I officially call this meeting of the veritas brigade to order. [<i>closes his eyes</i>] Lux in tenebris.

<b>Starchie</b>: [<i>opens his eyes</i>] So, anybody have weird stuff to report?

<b>Nurse Pound Cake</b>: Well, sometimes at night, I see a shadowy figure around <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a>'s tower. I have a feeling it might be otherworldly!

<b>Starchie</b>: Whoa, this is some good stuff. We are this close to finally exposing the princess' shady dealings. [<i>shows Princess Bubblegum watching the meeting on a camera while eating</i>] Meanwhile, PB remains blissfully unaware up in her ivory tower. [<i>Princess Bubblegum snorts and laughs</i>]

<b>Kenneth</b>: Excuse me. I believe I've made a startling discovery of my own. [<i>takes a <a href="/wiki/Dimension_disruptor" title="Dimension disruptor">machine</a> out of his jacket pocket with a pickle taped to it</i>] I've developed this high-tech device. It broadcasts waves that—theoretically—disrupt parallel dimensions!

<b>Starchie</b>: Whoa, Kenny boy, you're blowing my mind. [<i>Kenneth chuckles, then an evil chuckle is heard</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Peace_Master" title="Peace Master">Peace Master</a></b>: So...a tinkerer, eh? Fiddling at the fringes of unknown realms. Tell me, Kenneth, will you be ready when the flames of those evil places consume everything you hold dear?! [<i>goes to Kenneth and hits the device out of his hand</i>] I thought not!

<b>Starchie</b>: Hey, Peace Master. [<i>gets hit in the face with Kenneth's device and falls backwards</i>] Ohh! [<i>Nurse Pound Cake gasps</i>] Oh! My noodle.

<b>Peace Master</b>: There is something very wrong dwelling in the Candy Kingdom...a dark entity I plan to purge from the face of <a href="/wiki/Land_of_Ooo" title="Land of Ooo">Ooo</a>.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>shows her watching the meeting</i>] Oh! Uh oh!

<b>Peace Master</b>: Its presence has infected every home, every place of business, even here in this very room.

<b>Peace Master</b>: [<i>growls</i>] Sorry, I hate evil so much.

<b>Starchie</b>: It's all cool, Peace Master. Truth sleuths keep it real.

<b>Peace Master</b>: Yes. As lone scouts, we may fall, but together we will stand as a mighty force! [<i>a device beeps, he takes it out of his pocket</i>] Oh, dang. I gotta go. [<i>starts to run to a window</i>] But I shall return in one hour! [<i>runs out the window</i>]

<b>Peace Master's Daughter</b>: Finally.

<b>Peace Master</b>: Uh, sorry about the wait, guys. Daddy was pontificating.

<b>Peace Master's Daughter</b>: [<i>they start to drive off</i>] Hey, Dad, can we go to the Sorcery and Dark Arts fair tomorrow?

<b>Peace Master</b>: No, honey, that stuff is highly inappropriate for kids. Daddy works very hard to protect you guys from that kind of stuff. If you only knew of the monstrosities that lurk around every corner.

<b>Peace Master's Son</b>: [<i>throws a shoe at Peace Master</i>] Dark Arts!

<b>Peace Master</b>: [<i>his children laugh, he groans</i>] Stop laughing! You're stressing daddy out! [<i>his baby vomits on him, causing him to crash into a building</i>] See?! See what happens when you mess with the dark arts? [<i>kicks the bumper of his car</i>] I'll get you, dark one! You wrecked Peace Master's minivan! [<i>growls and drives off, shows Peppermint Butler mad and walks off</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>running to a room, panting, <a href="/wiki/Colonel_Candy_Corn" title="Colonel Candy Corn">Colonel Candy Corn</a> and the Banana Guard are sleeping and snoring</i>] Yo! Red alert! [<i>the Banana Guard says "Oh, shoot"</i>] Right, guys? What'cha doin' about it?!

<b>Colonel Candy Corn</b>: Whoa, be careful about old man naptime, please. That could have been it for me just now.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: What is going on here? [<i>shows three other banana guards playing with a miniature set of land</i>]

<b>Banana Guard</b>: Don't. [<i>covers part of the set</i>] No! [<i>looks at another banana guard</i>] Hey, watch your pieces, man.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] I thought you were gonna whip these guys into shape, Colonel.

<b>Colonel Candy Corn</b>: PB, you can't teach a butterfly to bark. You know what I'm saying? [<i>shows two banana guards playing with pieces of the set</i>] Well, they like my stories.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>they come out of the tub and gasp for air</i>] What was your count?

<b>Jake</b>: Uh, 3 minutes. What about you?

<b>Finn</b>: Uh, 3 minutes, 30 seconds.

<b>Jake</b>: What's that? Your invisible watch?

<b>Finn</b>: No, I was just pointing at my wrist.

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: [<i>shows him meditating in the room with candles lit</i>] Uh, just a second.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Just leave it out for me. I'm gonna go find Finn or Rattleballs or somebody to run down this Peace Master bozo. [<i>Peppermint Butler says "Okay, take your time."</i>] "Take my time"? Alright.

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Ooh-wah, oooh-wah. My light will move in darkness. I go unseen by low level biddies. [<i>chants an incantation, shows him changing and getting armor put on</i>] Whah-ha!

<b>Peace Master</b>: [<i>the background changes back to the Candy Kingdom</i>] Look here, friends. The beast lies exposed!

<b>Starchie</b>: [<i>Peppermint Butler stands up</i>] Oh, this is a mistake. That's my boy, Peppermint Butler.

<b>Peace Master</b>: His powers of darkness made me go crazy and crash my minivan earlier!

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: You need to chill, Peace Master. I'm just a harmless, old butler. [<i>lifts his pant leg up a bit, revealing something shining</i>]

<b>Peace Master</b>: Mm? [<i>Peppermint Butler takes a little sword out of his sock and charges at Peace Master, his baby barfs on Peppermint Butler</i>] Ha ha! [<i>takes his hat off and covers Peppermint Butler with it</i>] In you go! You see this?! My dark wizard gobbler poots evil souls into the void.

<b>Starchie</b>: You can't do that to our friend!

<b>Peace Master</b>: Oh. I see how it is. Maybe y'all should get in here, too. [<i>they all scream and run off, shows Peppermint Butler floating in a green slime and gurgling, saying "My candy flesh!" Peace Master swings his hat in a circle</i>] Digest! [<i>laughs evilly</i>]

<b>Peace Master</b>: Noooo!

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Bam! [<i>throws Peace Master's son into the air</i>] Now you got a monster kid.

<b>Peace Master</b>: Son!

<b>Peace Master's Son</b>: [<i>flying through the air</i>] Look, Pappy! Dark magic!

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Remember, you still got two non-monster kids. And if you want to keep them that way, you better toss all your charms down the hole!

<b>Peace Master</b>: [<i>turns around</i>] I will smite thee.

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: A'ight. [<i>turns Peace Master's daughter into a fairy-like creature with wings, a tail, and a horn</i>]

<b>Peace Master's Daughter</b>: Whoa, sweet!
