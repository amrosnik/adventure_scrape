<b><a href="/wiki/Marceline" title="Marceline">Marceline</a></b>: Come on, Marce. It'll only hurt for a second.

[<i>Marceline is sitting in the shade of a lone tree in a desert. Her umbrella lies just out of reach in the sunlight.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: That's nothing in the face of eternity.

[<i>She pokes her fingertips out of the shade. They sizzle and burn.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>shrieks</i>] A second hurts really bad in the face of eternity. [<i>Her fingers re-heal.</i>] But only for a moment.

[<i>She tries three more times, shrieking each time her fingers burn.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Wait. I have an even better idea. [<i>takes bottle out of pocket</i>] Sunscreen. SPF 10... million. [<i>empties contents and rubs it on hand</i>] Hmm! I have exactly enough to reach my umbrella.

[<i>Just then, a gust of wind blows the umbrella away. Marceline does a double face-palm.</i>]
