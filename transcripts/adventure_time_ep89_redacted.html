<b>Finn, Jake, &amp; BMO</b>:  'Sup, Turtle Princess?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Awesome. [<i>Starts eating</i>]

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  How ya doin' out here?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Turtle Princess, the men out here will <i>not</i> leave me alone!

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  Huh... it must be nice.

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  Actually, I've never been able to work my T-lumps. I just know what I read in books. [<i>Gasps</i>] Hey! You should write a book telling me how to <i>do</i> it!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh, my Glob! Turtle Princess! I've always wanted to write trashy books for ladies! [<i>Snake hisses at her</i>] YAH!

<b>Jake</b>:  Aaah...

<b>Finn</b>:  Heh heh heh heh heh heh!

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  [<i>To Lumpy Space Princess</i>] You gotta go undercover and conduct your lump science on <i>him</i>. Prove to the world that even a white knight like Finn is no match for the power of your lumps!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  I'll do it! For the world! And for <i>you</i>, girl!

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  Oh, girl!

[<i>They both smile. Lumpy Space Princess grabs a plastic grocery bag off the ground and dons it like a spaghetti-strap dress. Scene shifts to the Grasslands; Lumpy Space Princess is going to the <a href="/wiki/Tree_Fort" title="Tree Fort">Tree Fort</a>.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Recording herself</i>] Day one: on my way to Finn and Jake's. Side-note: I look <i>fresh to death</i> with my new dress and purse. Mm! Mm! Mm!

<b>Jake</b>:  Hello?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Seductively</i>] Heeey, Jaaaake... Is <i>Finn</i> hooome...?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Wincing in disgust</i>] Ooh!

<b>Finn</b>:  'Sup, LSP?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh, hey. I'm answering that ad you put out for the adventure secretary.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wha?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Ugh... Hold on. I'll get it. [<i>Starts digging through bag</i>] Hold on. It's down in there. Okay, wait, I got it. Uh, here you go.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Reading fake ad</i>] "WANTED—ADVENTURE SECRETARY." [<i>Sniffs it</i>] Smells like fruit pie.

<b>Jake</b>:  It's nice of you to wanna be our secretary... but we don't need one.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Whispering to Jake</i>] Dude, look at 'er.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Messily slathering custard on her face</i>] Mmm... Oh, Glob...

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, it's sad. Come on. We've gotta help 'er.

[<i>Jake hesitates speaking for a moment</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Alright, LSP. Come inside.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Awesome. [<i>Recording herself</i>] Totally nailed the interview. [<i>Licks custard off face</i>]

[<i>The three walk inside.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  I'm gonna need a secretary desk! [<i>She immediately forces dishes off a table ("Rrr-AAAGH!") and puts her working equipment. Finn and Jake just look at each other.</i>] I'm starving! What's for dinner?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh. Uh... [<i>Checks fridge</i>] We got some blueberries.

<b>Jake</b>:  Jake has saltines.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Yuck. [<i>Recording herself</i>] Looks like I'll have to bust out these cobras to get a better dinner. [<i>Seductively</i>] Hey, Finn... [<i>Rubbing her lumps</i>] You got anything <i>better</i> to eat??

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  G'night, you guys! [<i>They go upstairs.</i>] [<i>Recording herself</i>] Finn is even more overpowered by my lumps than I thought. I guess at the end of the day, it's all about the lumps. [<i>Her phone rings (Lumpy Space Princess's ringtone is Turtle Princess saying, "Heeey, girl!" repeatedly) and she answers it.</i>]

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  [<i>On other end</i>] Hey, girl.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh, Turtle Princess! This book is coming out <i>awesome</i>!

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  Oh, good, girl! I can't wait to read it!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Thanks, girl.

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  Goodnight, girl.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Goodnight, girl. [<i>Hangs up</i>]

[<i>Scene shifts to the next morning. Lumpy Space Princess wakes up grunting and drooling.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  What's that?

[<i>Lumpy Space Princess goes outside to find Finn putting rocks in Jake.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  'Sup, LSP?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  What're you guys doing?

<b>Finn</b>:  We're carrying these rocks on an adventure, up to the <a href="/wiki/Mystery_Mountains" title="Mystery Mountains">Mystery Mountains</a>.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh, nuh-uh, I am <i>not</i> gonna carry rocks!

<b>Finn</b>:  That's okay. Jake can carry 'em.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yup.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Ugh... Fine... [<i>Picks up two rocks</i>] You're welcome, Finn.

[<i>Finn gives a thumbs up. The trio starts going to the mountains.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Ugh... My arms weren't meant to carry so many rocks, you guys!

<b>Finn</b>:  C'mon, LSP. You can make it.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Uuoohhh... [<i>Drops the rocks in exhaustion; her phone rings ("Heeey, girl! Heeey, girl!") and she answers.</i>] Turtle Princess, you can't call me! You're gonna blow my cover!

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  Good morning, girl.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Good morning, girl.

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  Would you be mad at me if I ask out Billy, that vulture who was hitting on you? I think he's cute and I would—

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, LSP, shake a leg.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Whisper</i>] Can't talk right now, girl! [<i>Hangs up</i>]

[<i>The trio arrives at the top of one of the mountains.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  The <a href="/wiki/Loch_of_Phantoms" title="Loch of Phantoms">Loch of Phantoms</a>. Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the <i>safe</i> path. [<i>Starts throwing rocks into the lake</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>To herself</i>] This is way too boring for my book. [<i>Acting</i>] Oh... my shoulder strap... Oh, my orange juice is comin' out... Ha! Gotch—Huh? [<i>Finn throws another rock in, paying no attention to her.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Haha! Jake! "Ker-ploop."

<b>Jake</b>:  Heh heh heh! "Ker-ploop."

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  <i>Not</i>... gotcha?

[<i>Finn throws another rock in the lake, and the rock stays on the lake's surface.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Alright!

[<i>Finn throws a bunch more rocks in to determine which path to walk in. The trio enters the cave opposite them. Sludge falls on Lumpy Space Princess.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Ugh! This place is <i>plops</i>, Finn!

<b>Finn</b>:  We can meetcha back at the tree house later if you want. [<i>Continuing on</i>] That weird light...

[<i>The trio eventually stops in front of a strange vortex.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Hey, <i>Finn</i>! Finn, my dress is slipping!!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Not paying attention</i>] Huh? Listen, LSP, we've gotta be carefu—

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: [<i>Swinging around her "dress"</i>] Oooh, my dress...[<i>her dress goes into the portal</i>]

[<i>She drifts into the portal.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  No, LSP! It's not safe!

[<i>Lumpy Space Princess gets trapped in a room full of mirrors.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Heeeeeeey... [<i>Noticing <a href="/wiki/Mirror_Finns" title="Mirror Finns">Finn</a> in a mirror</i>] Oh. Hey, Fiiiiinn...

[<i>Finn and Jake bang on the wall.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  She's <i>stuck</i> in there!

<b>Jake</b>:  We gotta bust through this wall!

[<i>They attack the wall.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  I knew you couldn't resist me, Finn. [<i>The reflection of Finn takes off his hat revealing long, luscious hair.</i>] Oh, lump. I took it too far! [<i>The Mirror Finns reach out for Lumpy Space Princess</i>] My powerful lumps have turned Finn into a grody monster! Get away, Finn! AAH, NO, AAAAAH!!! [<i>Finn and Jake bust in just in time to defeat the shadow Finns.</i>] OH, I CAN'T LOOK! [<i>Opens one eye</i>] Aah!

[<i>Finn and Jake finish defeating the shadow Finns and pant heavily.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  That was so crazy! What just <i>happened</i>?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh. Uh, Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors. Evil stuff happens when you look into them.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh, Glob... I <i>had</i> to look because I looked so <i>good</i>!

<b>Finn</b>:  LSP... you don't need a mirror to know you look good. [<i>Sheaths his sword and grabs Lumpy Space Princess's "dress."</i>] You're beautiful on the <i>inside</i>. Like... your <i>brain</i> and stuff!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Thanks for sayin' that stuff... and for saving me from those mirror-yous. That was pretty nice.

[<i>Finn smiles. Scene shifts back to the Tree Fort.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Okay. Time to write. Gonna make this... <i>trashy</i>. Turtle Princess'll be all, [<i>Imitating her</i>] "Oh, my gosh! Number one best-seller!" Hah... Yeah. [<i>She looks around with uncertainty and notices Finn sitting on a log outside.</i>] [<i>To Jake</i>] What's he <i>doing</i> out there?

<b>Jake</b>:  Sometimes, after an adventure, he likes to sit out there and think. [<i>Goes upstairs</i>]

[<i>Lumpy Space Princess looks at Finn. Her cellphone rings ("Heeey, girl! He—") and she answers.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Fearful</i>] Hello?

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  Hey, girl. Are you almost done with your book?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Oh... I'm <i>working</i> on it! I've been doing so much research!

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  Did Finn fall victim to your lumps?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Prevaricating</i>] Um... yeah...

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  Great! Bring in your manuscript right away! Click! [<i>Hangs up</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>To herself</i>] Yeah... A book about how I'm hot, and Finn only wants... He's so... hot. [<i>Gasps in realization and has flashbacks of Finn from earlier moments in the episode.</i>] ...Finn has the hottest lumps, but <i>his</i> lumps are on the <i>inside</i>! YAAAAGH!! [<i>Pushes equipment off desk in frustration</i>] HE'S GREAT!

[<i>Lumpy Space Princess begins typing a new manuscript. As she's typing, it begins to rain, and Finn runs inside. In response, Lumpy Space Princess hurriedly gathers up her manuscript and leaves as Finn enters.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh... Bye, LSP.

[<i>Scene cuts to the <a href="/wiki/Library" title="Library">Library</a>. Turtle Princess reads the manuscript confused.</i>]

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  This isn't what you said it'd be about...

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  I know, I—

<b>Turtle Princess</b>:  I LOVE IT!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  OH, MY GLOB!

[<i>Turtle Princess makes the cover and titles the book "I Wrote a Book." Billy screeches. Back at the Tree Fort, the rain clears, and Lumpy Space Princess returns.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Finn! You've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh. Yeah! Yeah, I have.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  Finn... I was never really your secretary, Finn. I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps because I'm so <i>hot</i>, Finn!!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Not seeing anything wrong with this</i>] Oh. Okay.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  But <i>you're</i> the one who's hot, Finn!!

<b>Finn</b>:  <i>Wow.</i> Uh, <i>thanks</i>!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  No... thank <i>you</i>. [<i>Goes over to a window and opens it to exit</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  LSP, YOU'RE WEARING <i>GARBAGE</i> FOR CLOTHES!!!!

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>:  [<i>Whisper</i>] Gotcha... [<i>Slowly exits and floats away from the tree house. Her floating falters for a moment as the episode ends.</i>]
