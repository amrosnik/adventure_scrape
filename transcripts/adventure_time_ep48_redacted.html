[<i>A copyright warning comes up on the screen</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  What's that?

<b>Finn</b>:  Just stuff that comes at the beginning of the movies.

<b>Finn</b>:  Calm down, y'all. We're gonna have Finn and Jake Movie Club next week for sure. Jake and I just have to find a movie without that warning.

[<i>The club members are happy and leave</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude, we've never found a movie without that warning.

<b>Finn</b>:  We're not gonna <i>find</i> a movie, Jake.

[<i>In the Tree Fort's treasure room, Finn is digging through a pile of gold coins</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Well, what are we gonna do?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Finds a camera and gasps</i>] We're gonna make one!

<b>Ice Cream</b>:  W-w-wait. How about this?

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  That's even better!

[<i>Clip ends</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhh, what do you think?

<b>Jake</b>:  I don't get it. It's just a bunch of random junk.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, I'm not engaged. I need to see something that reflects life as it is, but, you know, entertaining.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, like a romantic comedy.

<b>Finn</b>:  Exactly. An action adventure.

<b>Jake</b>:  Wait, that's not what I said.

<b>Finn</b>:  Let's get to filming!

[<i>At a waterfall, <a href="/wiki/Slime_Princess" title="Slime Princess">Slime Princess</a> at the top of the waterfall</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Through his megaphone</i>] Okay, Slime Princess! In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine, swim over the crocodiles, do a triple flip with a full twist and land clean. Don't fall in the water, or you'll get eaten alive. Action!

[<i>Slime Princess jumps and falls into the water where crocodiles leap at her, Finn and Jake are mouth agape, a crocodile rises out of the water with Slime Princess kissing its snout</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  No! No smooching! Cut.

<b>Jake</b>:  I thought it was great.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, we can't use any of it.

<b>Jake</b>:  I think we should use all of it.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, not all. We should throw away the parts where Slime Princess was smoochin'. That was dumb.

<b>Jake</b>:  What?

<b>Finn</b>:  Duuuumb-ah. [<i>Pronouncing the "b"</i>]

[<i>In a clearing, Lumpy Space Princess and <a href="/wiki/Peppermint_Butler" title="Peppermint Butler">Peppermint Butler</a> are at a picnic setting</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Okay, you're having a picnic, you're in love but you can't admit it. So you're having a playful food fight. And action.

[<i>Peppermint Butler throws a piece of cake at Lumpy Space Princess</i>]

<b>LSP</b>:  Why did you do that?

[<i>Lumpy Space Princess throws macaroni and cheese at Peppermint Butler; he throws ice cream at her and it becomes an all out food fight</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut, that was not what I wanted!

<b>Finn</b>:  That was awesome! We need to shoot more stuff like that.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Sigh</i>] What's next?

[<i>In the next scene, BMO is in a hole by a frog tied to a chariot, Finn is positioning the frog and adjusting the camera; Princess Bubblegum is standing on the side of the frog</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay PB, move back a little. [<i>She does</i>] Stop. [<i>Repositions the frog and the chariot</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Finn.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  How does this work?

<b>Finn</b>:  Umm, Jake's gonna get the frog to hop toward him [<i>Jake is standing with a stick with a fly tied to it</i>] and when he does, you're gonna run along side the chariot and it's gonna look like you're driving it.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Okay.

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah.

<b>Jake</b>:  How 'bout when the chariot takes off, she says something like, "Mmm, check, please."

<b>Finn</b>:  What? No, that's terrible. [<i>Jake looks annoyed</i>] And action!

[<i>Jake put the fly in front of the frog and it shoots its tongue at the fly and the tongue's recoil causes it to fall back on the chariot, breaking it, and the frog hops away</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  Check, please...?

<b>Finn</b>:  Hah, Jake. You... you brought the fly in too close!

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm sorry.

<b>Finn</b>:  Well, help me catch 'im.

[<i>They chase after the frog</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Well, I thought it was funny.

<b>Finn</b>:  This isn't a comedy!

<b>Jake</b>:  Not the way you're shootin' it.

<b>Finn</b>:  Look, just help me catch this guy.

<b>Jake</b>:  All right, but after this we do my part.

[<i>In a wedding scene</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Through a megaphone</i>] Okay, everyone. It's been a long day. A lot of... [<i>Chuckles</i>] A lot of running around, chasing frogs [<i>chuckles again</i>]. But we are makin' a movie, and this is the big wedding scene. <a href="/wiki/Mr._Cupcake" title="Mr. Cupcake" class="mw-redirect">Mr. Cupcake</a>, you're playing Todd Johnson.

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>:  Yes.

<b>Jake</b>:  And Lady, you confess that you never loved Todd Johnson and that you were just trying to win a bet with your snooty socialite friends.

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>:  알았어, 제이크. ("Okay, Jake.")

<b>Jake</b>:  And then, you both realize you do love each other and you both say "I do." And then Shelby, you say...

<b>Shelby</b>:  Check, please.

<b>Jake</b>:  Heh, heh, heh. Yeah. Don't forget to look right at the camera and slap your cheeks like this. [<i>Slaps his cheeks</i>] And 1, 2, 3 action!

[<i>Shelby stares angrily at Jake since he doesn't have hands to slap his cheeks</i>]

<b>Shelby</b>:  Do you, Todd Johnson, take this Rainicorn to be your lawfully married wife?

[<i>Mr. Cupcake starts to flex his eyebrows; Lady giggles and blushes; Mr. Cupcake begins to flex and pose his muscles; Jake looks uncomfortable</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Lady! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! [<i>To Mr. Cupcake</i>] I didn't tell you to flex out!

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>:  [<i>Rubs Jake's head</i>] 자기야, 흥분하지 마. ("Don't take it seriously, honey.")

<b>Jake</b>:  No, I don't like the way he's flexing at you.

<b>Mr. Cupcake</b>:  I don't hear her complaining.

<b>Jake</b>:  Why you... GAAH!

[<i>Jake tackles Mr. Cupcake, the camera switches to Shelby as sounds of a fight can be heard</i>]

<b>Shelby</b>:  Check, please.

[<i>In the Tree Fort</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  How much longer till you finish editing, BMO?

<b>BMO</b>:  About twenty hours.

<b>Finn</b>:  Twenty hours?!

<b>BMO</b>:  Yeah, you guys shot a lot of footage. About twenty hours.

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, let's talk about our movie.

<b>Jake</b>:  Okay.

<b>Finn</b>:  I think we shot a lot of great stuff.

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh-huh.

<b>Finn</b>:  But I'm thinkin' only half of it is usable.

<b>Jake</b>:  Me, too.

<b>Finn</b>:  Really?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, I was just thinking that.

<b>Finn</b>:  That's great!

<b>Jake</b>:  I know.

<b>Finn</b>:  You actually agree it's an action adventure!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yep, it—wait! No!

<b>Finn</b>:  What?

<b>Jake</b>:  Romantic comedy!

<b>Finn</b>:  What?!

<b>Jake</b>:  What do you mean "what"?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Who's right, BMO?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, me or Finn?

[<i>BMO clicks a button on himself, his face is replaced by a message: "BACK IN 5 MINUTES"</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  We'll ask him when he wakes up.

<b>Jake</b>:  Why wait? [<i>Pulls out a pen and paper and begins writing</i>] "Dear BMO, Please use only the best footage when cutting the movie. Love, Jake."

[<i>Finn takes the pen and paper</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  "And Finn."

<b>Jake</b>:  See you at the movie club, then.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, I'll be there.

<b>Jake</b>:  As will I.

<b>Finn</b>:  As will I, as well.

[<i>They both leave; BMO's face pops back on the screen</i>]

[<i>At the movie club, the club members and everyone who took part in the movie are present</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  It's, ahh, it's more of a romantic comedy. Right, BMO?

<b>BMO</b>:  Eeee...

<b>Finn</b>:  Well, I guess we'll see!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, I guess we will. Start the movie, BMO.

[<i>The club members clap and look nervous; Finn and Jake go to their seats</i>]

<b>LSP</b>:  [<i>Whispering</i>] It's a little awkward.

[<i>BMO sighs and presses a button on itself and its face shoots out rays of light; the crowd is impressed; electricity goes through a cord from BMO to a holograph player; the logo "A BFF Production" appears</i>]

<b>LSP</b>:  [<i>Whispering</i>] Oh, my gosh!

[<i>BMO sings "<a href="/wiki/Friends" title="Friends">Friends</a>" and plays clips of Finn and Jake and the video ends; the club applauds</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  BMO's right. Fighting over this movie junk is dumb. I'm sorry, man.

<b>Jake</b>:  Me too, dude.

[<i>Finn and Jake hug</i>]

<b>LSP</b>:  Oh, my gosh, you guys. I can't wait till next week's movie club.

<b>BMO</b>:  Check, please.
