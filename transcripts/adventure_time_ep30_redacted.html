<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>moaning sickly</i>] Blankie me. Blankie me, Finn!

<b>Finn</b>:  I'll get your blanket dude, where is it?

<b>Jake</b>:  Right here. [<i>touching the blanket on right side of his bed</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Why don't you just get it yourself?

<b>Jake</b>:  Because I'm sick! [<i>making a shriveled face</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Poor guy...

[<i>Jake is moaning sickly again. Finn puts the blanket on Jake.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Too hot! [<i>pushes the blanket off</i>] URGGH!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh man, Jake, is there anything I can do to make you feel better?

<b>Jake</b>:  Soup me, Finny.

[<i>The scene cuts to another scene where Finn is holding soup for Jake.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Soup-flavored cure coming on through. [<i>sniffs and dumps the soup in Jake's mouth. Jake waits a bit, then swallows</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Do you feel better now?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yes. [<i>Jake throws up all the soup, which gets all over Finn</i>] Tell me a story... [<i>Followed by a long pause</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Once upon a time...

<b>Jake</b>:  No! I already heard that story before.

<b>Finn</b>:  But you've all ready heard all of my stories before.

<b>Jake</b>:  Make me a new one, Finn. A new story.

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay... got it! Once upon a time...

<b>Jake</b>:  Nooo! [<i>Jake makes puppy eyes while staring at Finn</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What's the matter?

<b>Jake</b>:  I don't want a made-up story. I need a real story.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmm. Now you hang on, my friend. I'll be right back. [<i>goes outside</i>] Okay, world, give me a story for Jake! [<i>looks around</i>] Huh! [<i>he notices a leaf floating in the wind, with a <a href="/wiki/Snail" title="Snail">snail</a> riding the leaf. Finn laughs and goes back inside</i>] Jake, Jake! Check it out! This true story is going to totally cure you!

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh my gosh! What is it?

<b>Finn</b>:  First, the leaf fell off a tree. But wa-w-w-wait.

<b>Jake</b>:  Spit it out.

<b>Finn</b>:  The snail was on the leaf. The end.

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh no, now I feel a thousand times worse. Finn, a story's gotta have excitement, romance... [<i>his eyes turn shiny</i>] ...suspense, [<i>dragging out the word and pulling his eyelids down</i>] and it has to have a happy ending.

<b>Finn</b>:  But I don't know how to make that stuff happen!

<b>Jake</b>:  That's okay, buddy. Just dig me a hole and -- actually, two holes. One for my guts and one for my face, 'cause when I die, my guts are gonna blow outta my face.

<b>Finn</b>:  I am not gonna let that happen, dude.

<b>Jake</b>:  Then go get me that story. [<i>pulls out a paper</i>] And make sure it has all the stuff on this list.

<b>Finn</b>:  I'll be back as fast as a can. I won't let your guts blow outta your face. [<i>he goes outside runs over a log, and pulls out the list Jake wrote. It is poorly written and says, romance, fight, suspense, and a happy end</i>] Hmm. Romance. That should be easy. [<i>puts list in his pocket and looks around, then looks under a rock, finding two <a href="/wiki/Ant_(Storytelling)" title="Ant (Storytelling)">ants</a> underneath</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, how 'bout you two. Are y'all in love?

<b>Boy ant</b>:  La ba ghee na goo da dee da?

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh...

<b>Boy ant</b>:  La na ghee ga ra la na!

<b>Finn</b>:  Umm. [<i>puts rock down, hears <a href="/wiki/Rodents" title="Rodents">squirrels</a> napping, and looks in the tree where they are</i>] Are y'all kissing in there?

<b>Squirrels</b>:  Ah! [<i>chattering</i>] [<i>they run into each other and fall down</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmm. Maybe I should smooooth out my approach a bit. ♪Normal guy, forest guy. Just like normal forest guy.♪ [<i>trips over a stick</i>] Whoa! [<i>Stops when he sees a <a href="/wiki/Mr._Fox" title="Mr. Fox">fox</a> and a goose, <a href="/wiki/Boobafina" title="Boobafina">Boobafina</a></i>]. Hey, so, uh, yeah... so, yeah, can I, umm... can I watch you guys kissing?

<b>Boobafina</b>:  What!?!

<b>Mr. Fox</b>:  Uh!

<b>Finn</b>:  I just need to for my friend! He's really sick and unless I tell him about watching you guys kissing and...

<b>Boobafina</b>:  What a weirdo! You're one sick man, mister...

<b>Mr. Fox</b>:  [<i>shakes his head</i>] Yeah, what's this "friend's" [<i>making airquotes</i>] name, huh?

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake! His name's Jake.

<b>Mr. Fox</b>:  Yeah, right. Sounds pretty fake. C'mon, Boobafina, let's get out of here.

<b>Boobafina</b>:  Yeah.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait! I'll do anything! [<i>they look back at Finn</i>]

<b>Mr. Fox</b>:  Would you eat dirt?

<b>Finn</b>:  I would for Jake! [<i>eats some dirt</i>] Okay, now you guys kiss.

<b>Boobafina</b>:  Man, what a freak.

<b>Mr. Fox</b>:  Let's go.

<b>Finn</b>:  What! No! Jake needs this! Stop! [<i>he grabs them and pushes them together, forcing a kiss</i>] Just come on!

<b>Boobafina</b>:  What? No!

<b>Mr. Fox</b>:  Ah, wait!!! [<i>against their will, they kiss. Finn stops pushing them and throws them</i>]

<b>Boobafina and Mr. Fox</b>:  AUGGH!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>face reddening</i>] You see, no big deal.

<b>Boobafina</b>:  I [<i>coughs</i>] can't believe you let me do that! I'm secretly in love with <a href="/wiki/Mr._Goose" title="Mr. Goose">Mr. Goose</a>, and now he'll never love me because now I'm soiled! [<i>sobs and runs away</i>]

<b>Mr. Fox</b>:  Oh no, oh no! I really did want to kiss Boobafina! I'm secretly in love with her!

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay, sweet!

<b>Mr. Fox</b>:  No, no. It had to happen naturally! Now she'll never love me! [<i>sobs and runs away</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Ugh! [<i>slaps his forehead</i>] That wasn't smooth, but it's all worth it to save Jake. Whatever it takes. Okay, a good fight... [<i>Finn sees a <a href="/wiki/Teenage_Bear" title="Teenage Bear">teenage bear</a> graffitiing a wall and walks up to him</i>] Hey, you want to fight me?

<b>Teenage Bear</b>:  Oh heck yeah! I've been waiting for this my whole life! Yes! [<i>laughs</i>]

<b>Teenage Bear</b>:  You never let me do anything! Grr! [<i>he tries to smack his mom, then jumps at Finn, who Finn punches him to the ground</i>]

<b>Momma Bear</b>:  You killed him!

<b>Teenage Bear</b>:  [<i>wakes up</i>] Mom, quit touching me!

<b>Momma Bear</b>:  You killed him and now he's dead!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>running away</i>] He's probably not dead. I'm sorry though, that you think he's dead. Mmm, I don't want to hurt aminals, but - but Jake - [<i>Finn stops running, looks at the list, and points to suspense</i>] Okay, what's next? [<i>he looks around, sees a flower, a radio, the snail on the leaf and some birds</i>] Ohhhhhhhhhh, suspense... [<i>holding up his fists, he walks up to the birds, picks up a rock and has a thought</i>]

<b>Finn [<i>In Finn's thoughts</i>]</b>:  Hey you guys, you wanna die? [<i>the birds get scared and pass out. They fall out of the nest. The mom comes.</i>]

<b>Momma Bird [<i>In Finn's thoughts</i>]</b>:  Boys! Boys! Have you seen my boys?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>really scared</i>] No! [<i>Turns around and throws the rock on the ground which makes the birds fly away. He kicks the rock</i>] Awwwwww, I can't do it!
