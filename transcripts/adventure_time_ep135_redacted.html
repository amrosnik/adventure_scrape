[<i>Ice King sprays air freshener, and Finn and Jake cough.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Yeah, I'm just crashing here while the <a href="/wiki/Penguins" title="Penguins">penguins</a> rebuild. I've given <a href="/wiki/Gunter" title="Gunter">Gunter</a> temporary reign.

[<i>Gunter, wearing Ice King's crown, is shown constructing ice structures.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Should be fine.

<b>Finn</b>: Flame Princess isn't crazy.

<b>Ice King</b>: You're blind, Finn. You're blind—wait, she isn't here, is she?

<b>Finn</b>: No.

<b>Ice King</b>: Whew!

<b>Finn</b>: She said she wanted time to herself. [<i>walks out</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Yeesh.

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, breakups are tough.

<b>Ice King</b>: Heh, yeah, like, remember how you and I were married?

[<i>Scene cuts to a forest with smoke rising from it. Flame Princess rips up some grass and burns it.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Uh! It's so confusing!

[<i>A spider-like creature lowers itself on its silk near Flame Princess.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Hmm? [<i>to creature</i>] I thought Finn was a stand-up guy, you know? But he basically betrayed me.

[<i>Spider creature shakes his head sympathetically.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Why do people even <i>have</i> secrets?

[<i>Her <a href="/wiki/Flame_Powers" title="Flame Powers">heat radiation</a> intensifies and the spider hurriedly scrambles up its silk.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>: It's like that in the <a href="/wiki/Fire_Kingdom" title="Fire Kingdom">Fire Kingdom</a>, too. Everyone is all deceitful and Shakespeare. But out here doesn't seem any different. [<i>scribbling sounds are heard</i>] Why do I have to feel like this? [<i>hears scribbling sounds</i>] And what is that noise?! Grrr!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Eh.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: [<i>squints</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>turning off invisibility</i>] Yeah, yeah. Just act like I'm not here.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: [<i>gasps</i>] Are you spying on me?!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: What?! No, of course not!

[<i>Several cameras and a microphone spontaneously reveal themselves. Princess Bubblegum hits a button on her watch and they become invisible again.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I was observing you—for research. [<i>sighs</i>] You're a threat, Flame Princess. Your emotions are directly linked to your combustion levels. But if I can create a scientific model that describes your complete elemental matrix, I can isolate and suppress your more... volatile traits.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: So, if you do your research, you'll know how to cut off my emotions so I won't feel like this?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Umm, yeah, basically!

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Then I'll help you.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: You will?

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Yes. I'll do whatever it takes.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>talking into microphone</i>] Once I press this button, you'll be subjected to a battery of tests to gauge your reflexes, stamina, and your reaction to various emotional stimuli.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: This is going to help me understand myself?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: There's a 40% chance we'll be able to identify and isolate your chemical components—and yes, understand you in a very scientific way.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Oh. That's good... I guess.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Initiate test. [<i>a phone drops down and knocks her hand away from the button</i>] Yah. [<i>puts phone to her ear</i>] Hello?

<b>Jake</b>: Princess! We need you and your <a href="/wiki/Ball_Blam_Burglerber" title="Ball Blam Burglerber">Ball Blam Burglerber</a> right away! Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes, or <a href="/wiki/Snow-a-constrictors" title="Snow-a-constrictors">snow-a-constrictors</a>!

[<i>Princess Bubblegum hits the button, lowering a large metal contraption towards Flame Princess. A small screen hanging by a cord drops down.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Okay, Cinnamon Bun, all you have to do is write down the numbers that appear on this monitor. Can you do that one thing?

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Yes.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh, one other thing. Do <i>not</i> open that door. [<i>points to a door behind Flame Princess</i>] So that's two things: write down the numbers, do not open that door. Got it?

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Yes, Princess.

[<i>Scene cuts to Cinnamon Bun opening the very same door as the floor underneath him stretches toward Flame Princess.</i>]

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Hello.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Hello.

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: You look sad.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Yeah, but mostly I'm confused.

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Ha, me too.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Really?

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Yeah. Bubblegum is bad.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: She is?!

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: I don't know. Wanna pet my dog?! He lives at my house.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: What about the tests?

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: I'm not good at tests.

[<i>Scene cuts to Cinnamon Bun's house, where Flame Princess is sitting on the couch next to Cinnamon Bun's "dog" (a squash with a mop on its head). Cinnamon Bun is preparing tea.</i>]

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: La-de-da-de-da [<i>hums</i>] His name is Jake, but he's not the real Jake. [<i>walks into coffee table, leaving a notch in his leg</i>] Ow. My body is soft. [<i>extends leg toward Flame Princess</i>]

[<i>Flame Princess places her hand on the wound, healing it perfectly.</i>]

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: [<i>gasps</i>] [<i>shakes his leg</i>] We're friends.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Yeah, I really get you, but sometimes friends are hard to understand. Sometimes you think you know them, but you find out they're just playing mind games.

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Is the princess your friend?

<b>Flame Princess</b>: I don't know.

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Yeah, because why did she lock you up in jail when you were a little baby? That was a weird friend thing.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: [<i>gasps</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I found your lost daughter.

<b>Flame King</b>: I-I don't remember losing anything.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Pssh.

<b>Flame King</b>: Okay, you got me. I had her sent to wander in the woods. I was in fear of being usurped. Come on.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: That's your problem, but you can't just let her run around the woods. She's too dangerous. Find some way to contain her power, or I will.

<b>Flame King</b>: Pssh, fine.

[<i>Scene cuts to baby Flame Princess in the <a href="/wiki/Lantern" title="Lantern">lantern</a>.</i>]

[<i>Scene cuts back to Flame Princess in Cinnamon Bun's house.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>: [<i>stands up</i>] [<i>groans in frustration</i>] Is everybody in this world hiding something?

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: It's fun to hide.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: You're all right. Why can't everybody be honest like you? Maybe I should just go back where I belong.

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Wait, do you mean baby jail?

<b>Flame Princess</b>: I don't know, man.

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Mmmm...

[<i>Scene cuts to Finn and Princess Bubblegum walking up to a metal door.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Fighting snow-a-constrictors really helped take my mind off things.

[<i>Finn shakes snow off his head as Princess Bubblegum pushes buttons on a keypad next to the door.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: So, uh, why am I here again?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh, I just wanted to measure Flame Princess's reaction when confronted by the guy who broke her heart.

[<i>Finn frowns, and the door opens.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Hey, Cinnamon Bun, I'm—[<i>gasps</i>]

[<i>The metal contraption is out of control, frantically moving up and down and smoking.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: CINNAMON BUN!!!

[<i>Scene cuts to Cinnamon Bun's house. Finn and Princess Bubblegum arrive via carriage and walk up to the door.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: There's a note [<i>reading it</i>] "Gon 2 fyr kingdum. Pleez watch dog."

[<i>Cinnamon Bun's "dog" is on the doorstep next to a bowl of dog food.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, this is terrible! If Flame Princess goes back there, her evil dad will lock her up again!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  And if she's imprisoned, I won't be able to complete my tests, and I'll have wasted my precious time!

<b>Finn</b>: We gotta save her. Let's doogie!

[<i>Scene cuts to Fire Kingdom. Finn and Princess Bubblegum, dressed in fireproof suits, walk up to a couple <a href="/wiki/Flame_Guard" title="Flame Guard">Flame Guards</a>.</i>]

<b>Flame Guard #1</b>: State your business here, and be quick about it. Sorry, I'm on edge 'cause I'm worried that Jerry here will find out I'm dating his sister.

[<i>Jerry turns his head.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Listen, we need to get into the castle right now.

<b>Flame Guard #1</b>: Yeah, but why?

<b>Finn</b>: Grrr! So I can go to your mama's house! Now get outta my way!

<b>Jerry</b>: Doesn't your mom live in a nursing home?

<b>Flame Guard #1</b>: Yeah, and in a different city. C'mon, dude, you gotta be honest here.

<b>Finn</b>: Honest my fist! [<i>punches Flame Guard, pushes him down, and headbutts Jerry</i>] Come on, Princess!

[<i>The two run inside but are blasted back by a huge fireball.</i>]

<b>Flame Guard #2</b>: D'aw, yeah! Gonna scramble you and fry you up for brunch! I try to act tough but I really wanted to be a chef.

<b>Finn</b>: Man.

[<i>A <a href="/wiki/Flame_People" title="Flame People">Flame Person</a> walks up to the three guards.</i>]

<b>Jerry</b>: Halt. What is your business here?

<b>Flame Person</b>: I need to get inside to file my taxes. Also I like using the bathroom here. Also I like to crop dust the lobby.

<b>Flame Guard #2</b>: Pass, friend.

<b>Finn</b>: Alright, so you wanna get nasty? One time, I blew a snot bubble that broke off and floated away. Then it hit some lady's baby in the face, and it started crying.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: And I really enjoy the taste of envelopes.

<b>Flame Guard #1</b>: Uh, that's cool and all, but you still haven't told us why you want to get in.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: We need to see the king?

<b>Flame Guard #1</b>: Well, why didn't you just say so? Right this way, friends. [<i>leads them inside</i>] There you go: [<i>Flame Princess is seated on the throne wearing royal garb</i>] the new Flame King.

<b>Finn</b>: Flame Princess?

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Finn?

<b>Finn</b>: You're okay! Um, how's it going?

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Pretty good. Cinnamon Bun and I staged a coup and I overthrew my dad.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh-ho, that's why the guards were wigging out.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: That is the new way in the Fire Kingdom. Total honesty is the law of the land—no secrets.

<b>Finn</b>: Oh.

<b>Flame King</b>: [<i>from inside lantern</i>] Right, can you believe this nonsense? Once I get outta here, I'm gonna ground you for real. No snacks, no friends, no popular music.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: You never let me have any of those things! You were a selfish king and a bad parent!

<b>Flame King</b>: But I did it for you, honey—for you not to overthrow me like you just did.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: You belong in that lamp! And if you don't settle down, you'll have to answer to Cinnamon Bun!

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: [<i>wearing a conical fire hat</i>] Hi.

<b>Finn</b>: Wow. She's even awesomer than I remember.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Take off that silly hat. We're going home.

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: No. Look, [<i>pets <a href="/wiki/Jake_2" title="Jake 2">Jake 2</a></i>] got a real dog now! Hah.

<b>Finn</b>: Flame Princess, listen. I'm really sorry I lied and hurt your feelings, and I was a big fat jerk—

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Finn, it's okay. It's in the past now.

<b>Finn</b>: So, does that mean we're still going out?

<b>Flame Princess</b>: No. I've realized my place is here, ruling these weak and vicious Fire People.

<b>Finn</b>: I see. [<i>gets on the ground and goes into fetal position</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>: But we're cool. You're welcome to come back and hang out whenever you like if you promise me one thing.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>stands up</i>] Anything.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: That you'll be completely honest with me.

<b>Finn</b>: Heh. Okay. I promise.

<b>Flame Princess</b>: [<i>laughs lightly</i>] I'm serious.

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm.
