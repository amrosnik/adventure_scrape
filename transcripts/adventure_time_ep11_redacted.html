<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>:  No way!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yes way, it did. And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist.

[<i>warbling with tongue</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Ah, jeez! Jake, is this stuff you're saying true? Or are you just trying to mess me up? You have to be honest.

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, it's true, man. I heard it through a reliable source.

<b>Finn</b>:  Reliable? Rats!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah. Some say it haunted this very tree!

<b>Finn</b>:  This tree?!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>ominously</i>] Good niiiight...

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake?

[<i>Jake warbling downstairs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  You're full of it, Jake!

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh? [<i>Lightning crashes, and the figure's scary face is seen</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  AAAAAH!!! [<i>Runs downstairs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake! Jake! I saw someone outside the window! It must be the vampire, and I think we're unprepared, so I--

<b>Jake</b>:  Relax, buddy. I made that story up. I was just trying to scare you.

<b>Finn</b>:  But you said you heard it from a reliable source!

<b>Jake</b>:  Ha ha! I made that up, too. I was trying to scare you, and it worked! [<i>laughs</i>]

[<i>the window blows open by itself, the lights go out, and Jake screams</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  No one's outside.

<b>Jake</b>:  Whew!

<b>Finn</b>:  It was just the wind, scaredy-cat.

<b>Jake</b>:  I wasn't scared, I was singing. I was singing my scream song. Ahh! Ahh! AAaah-uh-aah!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>afraid</i>] Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Don't suck our blood!

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>laughing</i>] Calm down, weenies. I'm not gonna do that. [<i>Lights candles</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Soooo, you don't suck blood?

<b>Marceline</b>:  Sometimes, I do. But it's not the blood that I like. It's the color. I eat shades of red.

[<i>Sucks the red out of a strawberry, and gives it to Finn</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  Ugh, I am exhausted. I've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo. And I've seen some stuff that would really make you say "like what?"

<b>Finn</b>:  Like what?

<b>Marceline</b>:  I encountered a school of goldfish beasts. [<i>A flashback of Marceline riding giant goldfish</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Nuts?

<b>Marceline</b>: Oh, these aren't ordinary nuts. [<i>Squeezes the nuts and they become little creatures. One squirts Finn with ink.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>laughs</i>] You're wonderful.

<b>Jake</b>:  Um, yeah. Thank you for not sucking our blood.

<b>Marceline</b>:  You guys seem cool, too, but as you can imagine, I'm really tired, so you two should probably get going.

<b>Finn</b>:  What?

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] Look. [<i>She uses psychokinesis and moves a picture frame and reveals an "M" carved into the tree</i>] "M" for "Marceline."

<b>Jake</b>:  Aw, man.

<b>Marceline</b>:  I carved in this tree years ago. Way before you two rascals started squatting here. [<i>Flings them out</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  But seriously guys, thanks for keeping the place warm for me, I mean really great!

[<i>Shuts the door</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  Good night!

<b>Jake</b>:  Come on, Finn. Let's get out of here.

<b>Finn</b>:  She can't kick us out of our house!

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn!

<b>Finn</b>:  Get down here, lady, and fight me!

<b>Jake</b>:  She's a vampire, dude!

[<i>Marceline sucks the red out of a crumpet, and throws it onto Finn</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm gonna kill her.

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you. There's no question!

[<i>Marceline hisses at them and then walks away, laughing</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  But, what about our home?

<b>Jake</b>:  A VAMPIRE TOOK IT! Aw, we should go house-hunting. Bag us a new house.

<b>Finn</b>:  But I like our home.

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn, house-hunting is wild! You've got to try it.

<b>Finn</b>:  Really?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, man! It is so nuts!

<b>Finn</b>:  You always know what to say.

<b>Jake</b>:  Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop!

<b>Finn</b>:  This is weak! I don't even like any of these places. I wanna go home.

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn, let me tell you a little something about what home really means. [<i>plays viola</i>] La, la, la... [<i>singing</i>] Home isn't a place, let me give you a clue... Home is anywhere, where people care about you...

<b>Finn</b>:  I don't wanna hear a lecture, dude! I just wanna go home...

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>singing</i>] But, home is where your heart is, Finn! And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right here inside you when I'm sitting here beside you! [<i>talking</i>] With your lucky stars to guide you from above. [<i>They look up, a star floats around, then poofs and disappears</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, I guess I'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my... souse.

<b>Jake</b>:  I'd rather be dancing with some babes!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>laughs</i>] Shut up, dude!

<b>Jake</b>:  Ew... Gross. This place looks gross!
