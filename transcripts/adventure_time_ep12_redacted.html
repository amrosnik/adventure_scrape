<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>gasping for breath</i>] How are we supposed to get that basket back if it keeps being stolen?! [<i>grunts in frustration</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey! We can steal a new one from that guy! [<i>Jake points to a '<a href="/wiki/Baskets_%26_Boots" title="Baskets &amp; Boots">Baskets &amp; Boots</a>' store.

I'd like to steal me one of them pairs of boots, especially.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, Jake. We can't steal. We have to stay pure!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>reluctantly</i>] Okay.

<b>Penny</b>:  I have an idea! My mom used to tell me that there's a <a href="/wiki/King_of_Thieves" title="King of Thieves">King of Thieves</a> who lives in the center of the city, and everything that gets stolen from little girls ends up at his tower. Maybe we'd find my basket in his treasure chest!

<b>Finn</b>:  That's a great idea, Penny!

<b>Penny</b>:  There's one thing, though. The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier. Which magically keeps thieves out.

<b>Finn</b>:  Have you forgotten?! We three ain't thieves! We're pure! Right, Jake? [<i>Finn turns to look at Jake, but he isn't there.</i>] Jake?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>tiptoeing towards Baskets &amp; Boots and whispering</i>] Just gotta steal these boots...

<b>Finn</b>:  Bells. That way, I'll hear you if you try to steal again.

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh. Hmm. [<i>shakes bells</i>]

[<i>Scene switches to King of Thieves' tower. Finn, Penny, and Jake are walking up stairs to reach the top</i>]

<b>Penny</b>:  The King of Thieves' tower is right up here.

<b>Finn</b>:  Woah. [<i>The tower is shown surrounded by a light blue aura.</i>] You read to pass through, Penny?

<b>Penny</b>:  I'm too afraid! Is it okay if I wait out here?

<b>Finn</b>:  Sure. C'mon, let's go, Jake!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] Comin'! [<i>Jake is wearing a pair of red boots.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, where'd you get those boots?

<b>Jake</b>:  Huh, what? What boots? [<i>looks down</i>] Oh, no! I stole! The city! It took advantage of me!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] Jake, you're a thief now! You won't be able to get in anymore!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yes, I can. [<i>runs up to the barrier and gets knocked back</i>] Oh. [<i>chuckles</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] It's up to me, now.

<b>Penny</b>:  Legend says you'll find the loot in the King of Thieves' chest. Good luck, Finn! Oh, yeah, and that high window is the only entrance.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmm. Alright, wish me luck!

<b>Jake</b>:  She already did, man.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, yeah. Right. [<i>passes through the barrier and starts to climb the tower while Jake cheers him on.

[<i>Scene changes to outside, where Jake and Penny are waiting.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  You see, if you have too much earwax, you won't be able to hear anymore.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>exiting the tower</i>] I got it, guys!

<b>Penny</b>:  The chest! Gimme that! [<i>grabs the chest from Finn</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Huh?

[<i>Penny puts the chest down. She pulls out a black crooked knife.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Woah, woah, woah. Easy, kid.

[<i>Penny opens the chest. Inside the chest are gold coins, jewels, a dagger and a Game Boy. She laughs maniacally.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What?! [<i>stammering</i>] Is you basket under all that gold?

<b>Penny</b>:  Of course it's not! I set you up to steal this chest of gold! I couldn't get past the barrier 'cause I'm a thief!

<b>Finn</b>:  But you're just a cute little girl!

<b>Penny</b>:  And, I'm a thief!

<b>Finn</b>:  Well, if this isn't yours, I'm gonna return it right now! [<i>closes the lid and starts to walk back toward the tower and gets knocked back</i>] Huh? [<i>puts hand and body against barrier, to no avail</i>] Why can't I...?

<b>Penny</b>:  Because you stole something in the city! Now you're a thief!

<b>Finn</b>:  No! [<i>yells</i>] No!!! What have I done?! What have I become?!

<b>Penny</b>:  You've become a thief, stupid! [<i>runs away with chest and laughs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>looks at hands</i>] My hands. They're all dirty. Covered in the dust of a criminal act! I'm a thief!

[<i>Suddenly, laughing is heard. Jake looks around for the source. Underneath him, the floor rises up and the Hag emerges.</i>]

<b>Hag</b>:  Oh, what did I tell you, boy? This city will get you, no matter how pure you think you are! [<i>laughs</i>] I was right.

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey, that's enough from you, Hag! [<i>puts feet around Hag's face and throws her away</i>] [<i>walks over to Finn</i>] Finn?

<b>Finn</b>:  Don't touch me! I'm impure, man! Unfit to be a hero! Unfit to be your friend.

<b>Jake</b>:  Come on, Finn, keep it together!

<b>Finn</b>:  No, Jake. This is a one-way path, down a jacked-up road. And I gotta walk it... alone.

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city. You're my buddy. Besides, I stole these boots. These super-big style boots. So I'm just as dirty as you are, Finn. We gotta walk this filthy path together!

<b>Finn</b>:  Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny.

<b>Jake</b>:  Cowabunga! [<i>stretches into a cape for Finn</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Cowabunga, indeed.

[<i>Finn and Jake start hopping over rooftops and into the house of the Short Goblin. They steal Crossbow Guy's crossbow from him and exit.

<b>Jake</b>:  Hi, Penny.

<b>Penny</b>:  Finn, please don't punch my lights out! I'm just a poor, homeless baby girl.

<b>Finn</b>:  I trusted you, Penny. You made me steal. And you took my purity. You ruined me!

<b>Penny</b>:  I'm sorry, Finn. [<i>reaches into a nearby bag</i>] Let me give you some uh, gems, or some gold, or uh, have some [<i>pulls out knife</i>] knife in your neck! [<i>Penny jumps at Finn</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Watch out, Finn! [<i>shoots boots at Penny, making her drop the knife and fall down</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Thanks, dude.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, dude.

<b>Penny</b>:  No! No! [<i>Bubbles fill the screen and once they disappear, Finn, Jake, and Penny are all clean.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Nice work, dude.

<b>Finn</b>:  She's purified!

<b>Penny</b>:  [<i>sparkles</i>] I feel...clean! Like all the filth of the city and wrongdoings are gone! Thank you F and J! I haven't felt like this since I was young!

<b>Finn</b>:  You're welcome.

<b>Jake</b>:  Woah, dude! [<i>rubs Finn, making squeaky sounds</i>] The soap got on us, too!

<b>Finn</b>:  We're clean!

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  Yes! [<i>fist pounds</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  This good deed we did has purified us once again. We're virgin islands! [<i><a href="/wiki/Cherub" title="Cherub">Cherubs</a> fly from off-screen, playing a trumpet and a harp. They steal the swords from Finn that he stole earlier.</i>]

<b>Penny</b>:  Finn, thanks for the second chance to live a pure life.

<b>Finn</b>:  And you know what that means, Penny. No more stealing! [<i>winks</i>]

<b>Penny</b>:  Never again.

<b>Finn</b>:  Well, I think it's time for us to get the math out of here.

<b>Penny</b>:  [<i>jumps up and gives Finn a hug</i>] I'm going to miss you, Finn!

<b>Finn</b>:  I'll miss you, too.

<b>Penny</b>:  [<i>exiting the tent</i>] G'bye!

<b>Jake</b>:  Woah, dude. Why are you naked? [<i>Finn is shown wearing nothing but his <a href="/wiki/Finn%27s_pack" title="Finn's pack">pack</a> and underpants.</i>]
