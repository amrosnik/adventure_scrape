<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah! You never fought them? They come out every day at four o’clock on the dot.

[<i>Jake reverts to his normal form.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: I guess that's because I meet <a href="/wiki/Lady_Rainicorn" title="Lady Rainicorn">Lady Rainicorn</a> every day at four o'clock on the dot. Oh shoot! I'm late!

<b>Finn</b>:  You should stay, man. At five o'clock every day, I chop both their heads off, and they grow them back for the next day.

<b>Jake</b>:  Aw, man, that sounds awesome! I do want to stay and fight those guys, but I also want to hang out with my girlfriend.

<b>Finn</b>:  Boo!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] I should probably go. I'll see ya later, buddy. [<i>Jake rides off in his bike.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Sleep! But we were supposed to play viola together!

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>:  미안해. ("I'm sorry.")] [<i>Kisses Jake on the head.</i>] 니가 늦게 왔잖아. ("It's because you came late.")

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, hey, Shelby.

[<i>Jake makes a kind of deflating noise.</i>]

<b>Shelby</b>:  No response, huh? Guess you're good.

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm fed up, Shelby!

<b>Shelby</b>:  Hmm?

<b>Jake</b>:  Whenever I hang out with Lady Rainicorn, I miss out on fun times with Finn.

[<i>Jake is using hand gestures to add emphasis, but he is riding a bike so he keeps swerving.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  And then when I hang out with Finn, I'm missin' out on Lady Rainicorn! [<i>He lifted his hands in the air and he crashes into a tree.</i>] Oh!

<b>Shelby</b>:  [<i>Popping out of the viola again.</i>] Hey, Jake, why don't you just hang out with both of them at the same time?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake props himself up, throwing the leaves off.</i>] And then I won't miss anything! Shelby! My problems are solved.

[<i>Screen wipes to Finn, Jake, and Lady Rainicorn having a picnic by a fire pit.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Ah, isn't this great? This is totally great. [<i>To Finn</i>] Isn't it?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Excitedly</i>] What? What did she say?

<b>Jake</b>:  She said she also thinks it's great.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah.

[<i>Silent pause.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmm... [<i>Jake crawls up in front of them.</i>] Hey, did you know that you both have an awesome sense of humor?

<b>Finn</b>:  We do?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah! Anybody have a joke?

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh, I have a joke! [<i>Laughs.</i>] Okay, [<i>laughs</i>] okay. Knock knock.

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>:  누구세요 ("Who's there?")

<b>Jake</b>:  She said, "who's there?"

<b>Finn</b>:  Diarrhea!

<b>Jake</b>:  쟤가 설사래. ("He said "diarrhea.")

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>:  어, 나도 들었어. 뭐야, 하나도 재미없잖아. ("Oh, I got it too. What was that? It hardly qualifies as a joke.") [<i>Sips drink</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Did she say diarrhea who?

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh, no. No, she didn't say, "diarrhea who?" She didn't... say it. Lady, how 'bout you tell a joke?

<b>Lady Rainicorn</b>:  글쎄.. 뭐가 있었을까? 아! 우리 완전히 다 벗고 상추밭 미친듯이 뛰어다닌 거 기억 나? [<i>Jake and Lady Rainicorn giggle</i>] 그 농부 아저씨 완전 맛이 갔었지! ("Maybe... What could it have been? Ah! Do you remember when we got completely naked, and frantically ran around in the farmer's cabbage patch? [<i>Jake and Lady giggle</i>] That farmer got crazy mad!")

<b>Finn</b>:  What's the joke?

<b>Jake</b>:  Uhh... well, the joke doesn’t translate very well.

<b>Finn</b>:  Man, I- I might leave. Is it okay if I leave? I kind of want to go fight something.

<b>Jake</b>: Noooo! Don’t leave. [<i>Gets up to pace.</i>] If there was only some way you two could talk to each other directly. [<i>Pause</i>] Oh, dude! I just remembered! There's a universal translator device at the bottom of <a href="/wiki/Lake_Szelezon" title="Lake Szelezon">Lake Szelezon</a>!

<b>Finn</b>: The lake guarded by evil <a href="/wiki/Lake_Knights" title="Lake Knights">Lake Knights</a>?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, I can't remember why I threw it in there. Let's all go and get it!

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa [<i>Runs towards Jake</i>] [<i>whispers</i>] Jake! You’re inviting Rainicorn? No offense, but isn't she a little too sweet for deadly adventure?

<b>Jake</b>:  Trust me, Finn, she’s the Rowdy Queen. She can do anything!

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmmm. Alright! Trust pound!

[<i>The camera shows them fist pounding and then the Adventure Time logo spins from in between their fists.</i>]

[<i>Finn fends off a few and Jake grabs a bunch and punches them. Lady attacks a few and Finn is seen strangling one knight when he notices the treasure at the bottom of the lake. He throws aside the dead lake knight and swims towards it. He grabs the translator and gives a thumbs up to Jake and Lady. Jake is Giving a thumbs up back when the lake starts rumbling. Finn is shocked when knights begin surrounding him from the crevasse surrounding the treasure.

[<i>They shout in victory.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Lady! You are incredible! You should adventure with us all the time!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>chuckles</i>] All according to plan.

<b>Lady</b>:  고마워, 나도 재밌었어. ("Thanks, I enjoyed it too.")

<b>Finn</b>:  Uhhh, what?

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Runs up to them</i>] Here's the translator. [<i>He puts the translator around Lady's neck</i>] Let’s see here. [<i>Turns on the device and switches through the options</i>] The voice options are... Old man, nerdy alien, ooor nightmare? [<i>He has it switched to nightmare</i>] Try sayin' something toots!

<b>Lady</b>:  [<i>Makes scratchy, grungy noises</i>] [<i>Jake looks disturbed and goes to change it to old man</i>]... and then I ate all the peaches in the orchard, and that farmer was sooo angry!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Laughs</i>] I like this voice!

<b>Lady</b>:  [<i>Jake switches it to nerdy aliens</i>] [<i>Lady makes some gurgley, indistinguishable noises</i>]

<b>Lady</b>:  [<i>Finn laughs again</i>] [<i>Jake switches it back to old man</i>]...and that's the end of my story.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] Well, at least with old man option we can understand him, I MEAN HER! I mean you sugar!

<b>Lady</b>:  Hop on my back and I'll give you a ride home!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>laughs</i>] Whatever you say grandpa! [<i>Flips onto her back</i>] Hai-yah!

<b>Lady</b>:  Come on my darling. Wrap your legs around me.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>] I remember why I drowned that translator now.

[<i>Screen wipes to Finn and Jake riding on Lady's back over a forest</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey grandpa, how are you able to fly if you don't have wings?

<b>Lady</b>:  Well, light travels from the sun. Then bounces off of our planet and then back into our eyes so we can perceive color.

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa! [<i>Being bounced by Lady’s wavy flying style</i>]

<b>Lady</b>:  My body can intercept that light and dance around on it. [<i>Jake is sliding off of her</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Lady! It's a little rocky in the back seat here!

[<i>Floats down into the trees and onto the ground</i>] [<i>He gets up</i>] Lady! Finn! [<i>He grows huge and shouts above the trees</i>] Y'all around here? [<i>Looks around</i>] Dang it! [<i>Turns to see fireworks coming from the trees accompanied by the sounds of Lady and Finn having fun with the rings</i>]

[<i>Screen cuts to Finn, Lady, and some animals cheering for the wizard</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>While the forest wizard does tricks and the small animals cheer</i>] Whoa! Did you see that!? This is like the funnest thing ever!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Burst through the trees and scares everyone away</i>] There you are! [<i>Shrinks down</i>] Where were you guys?

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait a minute, you didn't fly down with us?

<b>Lady</b>:  We thought you were behind us the whole time!

<b>Jake</b>:  Noooo! [<i>Looking sad</i>] I fell off your tail end! [<i>Turns and looks mad</i>] I was shouting your name!

<b>Lady</b>:  [<i>Comes up and nudges him</i>] Ooh! Honey pot, we probably couldn't here you because of the cloud density.

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake! Check out these power rings! [<i>The rings each expel some sort of magical display</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa. That's cool! You got ten of them?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah! Lady got some too.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Lady shows Jake her rings</i>] Oh, that’s cool.
