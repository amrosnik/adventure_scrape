[<i>The episode begins with <a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a> standing in a field of tree stumps.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: And here at this site, my Great Uncle <a href="/wiki/Gumbald" title="Gumbald">Gumbald</a> cut down all these taffy trees in a single night.

<b>Finn</b>: 'Cause those trees were evil... right, Princess Bubblegum?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Nah. Hey, but I bet they have a ton of stories about your <a href="/wiki/Humans" title="Humans">human</a> relatives.

<b>Finn</b>: Um... not really. I've never even met any other humans. If I think about it too much, I get all soul-searchy and weeeeiiirrrd...

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>Embarrassed</i>] Ohhh, boy... I've made things awkward. Well, let's forget about that. I brought you guys here because I need you to rip out all these stumps!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Half-heartedly, in a daze</i>] Okay... I guess so...

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, man, it'll be fun! [<i>Shrinks and gets in Finn's hand</i>] Toss the Jake-sploder! [<i>Finn tosses Jake towards a stump</i>] Nyeeeeh, boom!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Spiritedly</i>] SPA-MOW!!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>To Finn</i>] I'm glad to see you out of that funk... about being the only huma... [<i>Her voice trails off; she realizes what she said and gets embarrassed</i>] I mean... [<i>Walking away</i>] Well! I'm gonna scram! No hard feelings right? [<i>Exits</i>]

[<i>Jake lands in Finn's arms.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Again, man!

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Throwing Jake</i>] Huck!

[<i>Jake lands on something; there's a loud clang.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Ow!! Whoa... I don't think this is a stump.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Running over</i>] Huh? [<i>Moving bush</i>] It's a hatch.

<b>Jake</b>: A hatch? [<i>He jumps on it and opens the lid.</i>] We should check it out, ya think?! [<i>He jumps down.</i>] [<i>Excitedly</i>] Waaah!

<b>Finn</b>: Heh-heh. [<i>Finn jumps down, and the lid closes. He and Jake exit an entrance chamber with a ladder and enter a dark room filled with old, moldy garbage, water, and ruined buildings.</i>] S'dark, huh? [<i>Finn turns on a flashlight. They run further into the area.</i>] Whooooooaaaaaa!

<b>Jake</b>: What a dump! [<i>Finn's flashlight goes out. He tries to get it working again.</i>] Can you imagine the jerks that musta lived here?

[<i>A figure emerges behind them.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Turning to look</i>] Huh?!

[<i>The figure stares at them.</i>]

<b>Finn and Jake</b>: AAAAH!!

<b>Figure</b>: AAAAH!!

<b>Finn and Jake</b>: AAAAH!! [<i>They run backwards with a start and run into a pile of junk. Another figure emerges. Finn and Jake gasp then retreat.</i>]

<b>Figure</b>: Wee meeb youp nuh hur! [<i>Presumably: "We mean you no harm!"</i>]

[<i>Finn and Jake run while panting heavily. Many more of these figures emerge, surrounding the duo. Finn's flashlight works again; the creatures retreat. The first figure from earlier runs into Finn's light; she stops and stares at them like a deer in headlights. She looks at her shadow.</i>]

<b>Figure</b>: SHAHOW!! [<i>Presumably: "Shadow!!"</i>] [<i>The other creatures gasp.</i>] O my gra cup-ssah! [<i>She hides in a refrigerator.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: These people are so terrified... Scared of their own shadows...

<b>Jake</b>: We could rule them... like gods! [<i>Deviously</i>] ...Angry gods...

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>To humanoid</i>] Don't be scared, c'mon. [<i>The <a href="/wiki/Susan_Strong_(character)" title="Susan Strong (character)">creature</a> walks towards Finn cautiously.</i>] Yeah, it's okay. [<i>The humanoid goes into the light, revealing herself to very much resemble a human.</i>] Your... your face! You're... [<i>Yelling</i>] JUST LIKE ME!! [<i>She and the other creatures get spooked and retreat again.</i>] Hey, wait!

[<i>Jake stops Finn and shushes him.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Whispering</i>] Shh. They're startled. Ya gotta be gentle with wild animals.

<b>Finn</b>: I don't think they're animals, Jake. I think... this could be... a tribe of... humans!! [<i>Laughs happily</i>] What are these guys doing down here in this crummy hole?

<b>Jake</b>: I don't know, man. Maybe they just don't know any other thing.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>To creatures</i>] Hey, fellows! Don't you wanna get out of here?! I could take you to see the sun! [<i>The female creature tilts her head. Finn motions his hands to draw a circle.</i>] Suuuun. Suuuun.

<b>Susan</b>: Suhhhn... Ow la koo sow suhn. [<i>Presumably an agreement that she'll look at the sun.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: You poor things... Living down here has made you all weird, hasn't it? [<i>The creatures duck behind the trash and mumble to each other.</i>] Jake, I've got to save these guys! They're my people, and it's my duty to lead them outta this gross cave! Starting with you, Miss, uh... [<i>Grasping for her name</i>]

<b>Susan</b>: Suuhh... suhhhn... [<i>Presumably: "Sun."</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: ...Susan? [<i>Susan stands up.</i>] Pleased to meet you!

<b>Jake</b>: Well, let's bring 'er up!

[<i>Jake turns into a couch; Finn sits on him.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Patting Jake, to Susan</i>] C'mon.

[<i>Jake stretches himself, Finn, and Susan out of the cave. Finn opens the hatch and leaps out.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Aw, man, you're gonna love it up here, Susan!

<b>Susan</b>: [<i>Squinting</i>] Huh?

<b>Finn</b>: There's all sorts of wonders top-side!

[<i>Susan leaps onto the grass.</i>]

<b>Susan</b>: Aah! AAH!!

<b>Finn</b>: Susan, it's just grass.

[<i>Susan pants heavily and jumps on Jake's back.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Ooooh! Mah back!!

<b>Finn</b>: [To Susan] Grass can't hurt you. [<i>Patting grass</i>] See?

<b>Susan</b>: Graaaahhhss... [<i>She lands on the ground and feels the grass.</i>] Huh... huh... huh. [<i>She slams her face to the ground.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Oop. Ya killed 'er.

<b>Finn</b>: Wha?! I did?!

<b>Jake</b>: Yep. Felled by surface-world germs. [<i>Susan starts scurrying with her face still planted in the ground. Finn scowls at Jake.</i>] Heh. Just kiddin'.

[<i>Susan laughs as the plays in the grass. Finn and Jake stare. Susan rises with grass stains all over her.</i>]

<b>Susan</b>: Hahahahahahahaha! Two be cah reh ss... buh a thuh ahp fer ger... ss.

<b>Finn</b>: Aw, Susan... You got grass blood all over your face. [<i>Tries to wipe her with handkerchief</i>]

<b>Susan</b>: [<i>Scared</i>] YEEH!! ITSA PA TUH MUP!

<b>Finn</b>: Susan... a hankie won't hurt you.

<b>Susan</b>: [<i>Taking it</i>] Ohhhh. [<i>She wipes herself.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Frustrated sigh</i>] How'm I supposed to show 'er the wonders of Ooo if every little thing freaks her out?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Semi-French pronunciation</i>] Patience...

<b>Finn</b>: Very well. Then I shall introduce Susan to <a href="/wiki/Land_of_Ooo" title="Land of Ooo">Ooo</a>... by degrees!

[<i>A logo that says "INCREMENTAL TIME" pops up. A ruler goes through the word "TIME."</i>]

[<i>The three are now walking through the <a href="/wiki/Cotton_Candy_Forest" title="Cotton Candy Forest">Cotton Candy Forest</a>. Susan gasps and stops as she spots a <a href="/wiki/Pincer_Beetle" title="Pincer Beetle">beetle</a>.</i>]

<b>Susan</b>: [<i>Scared</i>] Manee mah nuhp lehp!

<b>Finn</b>: That can't hurt you! That's a dancing bug! [<i>The beetle starts dancing. Finn and Jake start dancing, too. After a while, Susan joins in.</i>] Yeah! Hahaha!

[<i>Scene transition; the three are now on the cliffs above <a href="/wiki/Red_Rock_Pass" title="Red Rock Pass">Red Rock Pass</a>. Susan gasps at a rock.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: That's just a rock. [<i>Punching it away</i>] A low-level enemy.

<b>Susan</b>: [<i>Relieved sigh</i>] Jus a rah. [<i>"Just a rock."</i>] [<i>She hugs another rock and squeezes it until it shatters.</i>]

[<i>Scene shifts to a <a href="/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forest</a> where the three are having a campfire. Finn opens a package of marshmallows as Jake plays his <a href="/wiki/Viola" title="Viola">viola</a>. A beaver rises in the bushes behind Susan. Susan recoils in fear and breathes heavily.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What's wrong?! [<i>He spots the beaver.</i>] Hey, hey, hey, it's okay! [<i>He feeds the beaver a marshmallow.</i>] See?

[<i>The beaver takes three more marshmallows and runs off. Finn and Susan laugh.</i>]

<b>Susan</b>: [<i>Singing and looking around</i>] Hm, hah, prety go-ah-suh pattah! [<i>"Pretty golden patterns!"</i>]

[<i>Finn decides to sing, too. He sings Susan <a href="/wiki/Susan_Strong_(song)" title="Susan Strong (song)">a song</a> about how glad he is that she's with him and Jake on the surface world. He hands Susan a stick with a marshmallow on it.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, Jake, how's your marshmallow, man?

<b>Jake</b>: Golden as a wheaty sunset! How's yours?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Staring at inflamed marshmallow</i>] Hmmm... [<i>He blows out the flame and eats the marshmallow.</i>] Perfect! [<i>Muffled</i>] How's yours, Susan?

[<i>Susan chews on the stick itself.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Heh. That's adorable. Hup!

[<i>Jake throws a marshmallow into Susan's mouth.</i>]

<b>Susan</b>: MMMM!! Ohhh... Tha is goo!! [<i>Presumably: "That is good!!"</i>] [<i>Susan ravenously attacks the marshmallow bag.</i>]

<b>Susan</b>: [<i>Whispering</i>] Finn, where's all the candy yuh werp talk ah bout?! [<i>Presumably: "Finn, where's all the candy you were talking about?!"</i>]

[<i>Back at the hatch, Susan busts out and blows a horn. The <a href="/wiki/Hyooman_tribe" title="Hyooman tribe">rest</a> come out of the hatch. They get scared as they touch the ground.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: I don't think that'll scare anybody...

<b>Finn</b>: NO DUH! She's...um...! She's... [<i>Noticing her menacing shadow</i>] Hey! Princess. I need a little wagon and your biggest roll of wax paper.

[<i>The tribe arrives.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Now, Princess Bubblegum! [<i>Princess Bubblegum lets the wax paper come rolling down.</i>] Now, Jake! [<i>Jake puts logs on a fire in a wagon. The Candy People's shadows emerge on the wax paper, and the tribe gets scared.</i>] It's working...

<b>Susan</b>: [<i>To tribe</i>] Wah!! Just shadows!

<b>Finn</b>: Aw, man! They've learned how to learn! Hide yourselves, Candy People! I'll try to make Susan see reason!

[<i>Jake blows on the fire to keep it lit.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: MY PEOPLE!! [<i>One of the tribe members pulls off his hood to reveal a fish-like head.</i>] HUH?!?! [<i>Another tribe member pulls off his hood to reveal his fish-like head.</i>] WHA?!?

[<i>Susan looks away at the others then reluctantly goes towards Finn.</i>] Susan... what are you??

[<i>Beat; Susan runs off; the fire behind Finn dies down. Finn turns around.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Is everyone okay? [<i>The Marshmallow Kids are pulling off burnt skin.</i>] Marshmallow Kids?

<b>Marshmallow Kid</b>: We'll just be gooey for a while.

[<i>They give their burnt skins to Finn and run off giggling. Finn stares forward in the direction that Susan ran off.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Running up to Finn</i>] Hey, buddy! We did it! Finn? You okay?

<b>Finn</b>: Jake, do you think she was human, or just another wild animal?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Beat</i>] We're all wild animals, brother.

[<i>Finn eats some burnt Marshmallow Kid skin.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Low, quiet voice</i>] Yeah... I guess we are... brother.
