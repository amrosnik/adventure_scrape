[<i>Finn and Rag Wizard are riding on Jake's shoulders, Jake is running</i>]

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  Faster!

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  Faster! She's in danger!

<b><a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></b>:  Who is he talking about?

<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>:  I have no idea.

<b>Jake</b>:  What?! Then why am I running so hard?

<b>Finn</b>:  Because...

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  Because she's in trouble!

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  Who is?!

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  <a href="/wiki/Marceline" title="Marceline">Marceline</a>!

<b>Finn</b>:  Faster, Jake!

<b>Jake</b>:  She's in trouble! [<i>runs faster</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline?

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  I'm her spirit animal.

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh.

[<i>They arrive at <a href="/wiki/Marceline%27s_house" title="Marceline's house">Marceline's house</a>, Marceline lying on her floor</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>gasp</i>] Marceline! What's wrong with her?

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber.

<b>Finn</b>:  Tell us how to break the spell.

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  I'll transport you into Marceline's mind where you will walk through her memories and find the memory core.

<b>Jake</b>:  Then what?

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  Find the memory of Marceline casting the sleep spell on herself. At your touch, you and the memory will be transported back to reality.

<b>Jake</b>:  But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself?

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms. Just legs. [<i>stretches leg towards Finn</i>] Yeah, there we go... oh. [<i>jabs Finn's forehead with toe</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  What? What'd you do to my forehead?

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow. Here, take this. [<i>gives Finn a sack</i>] It's a sack of magic powder. Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head.

[<i>Finn and Jake walk over to the couch and sits on it</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Like this? [<i>sprinkles powder on himself and Jake</i>]

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  Yep, like that. Feel sleepy?

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  Mmhm.

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  Good. Sleep now. But know this! If you fail, Marceline will be trapped in eternal sleep... forever!

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  [<i>gasp</i>]

<b>Rag Wizard</b>:  And ever. And ever.

[<i>Finn and Jake fall into darkness, sleeping. Lights come on</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>yawns</i>] Did it work?

Finn: [<i>rubs eyes</i>] Ugh, ah. I can't tell. I don't <i>feel</i> like I'm inside Marceline's memories.

<b>Jake</b>:  Me neither. Huh?

[<i>They walk beside the couch, which extends into a destroyed town-like area</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa. Whoa!

<b>Finn</b>:  So... if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline?

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmm... there she is! [<i>walks up to young Marceline</i>] Hey, little Marcy.

<b>Young Marceline</b>:  Who are you guys?

<b>Finn</b>:  We're Finn and Jake.

<b>Jake</b>:  We're your friends!

<b>Young Marceline</b>:  <a href="/wiki/Hambo" title="Hambo">Hambo</a> is my only friend. See? [<i>holds up Hambo</i>] You need another eyeball surgery, pal. Lucky for you, we found a donor. [<i>rips button from shirt</i>] Eyeball! Nurse, hand me the string. Yes, doctor. It's our last piece. Hold still. [<i>stitches button into Hambo</i>] I'm hurting you because I love you.

<b>Jake</b>:  Ahem!

<b>Young Marceline</b>:  What are <i>you</i> guys still doing here?

<b>Finn</b>:  We're trying to wake you up.

<b>Jake</b>:  Do you know where your memory core is?

<b>Young Marceline</b>:  Nope, but there might be anything behind that cellar door, and it rhymes with memory core!

<b>Jake</b>:  Ooo! Ooo! Could be jams and pickles down there!  [<i>opens door</i>] Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory; with food in it! Ooo, ice cream

<b>Finn</b>:  I want some! Huh? [<i>Finn and Jake enter Marceline's room while she is picking her nose</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>opens new door</i>] Come on, Finn!

[<i>Finn and Jake enter a broken down restaurant, Hunson Abadeer is eating Marceline's fries</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Yo, man.

<b><a href="/wiki/Hunson_Abadeer" title="Hunson Abadeer">Hunson Abadeer</a></b>:  Wha?

Finn: Don't eat those.

[<i>Teenage Marceline walks in, seeing her dad eating her fries</i>]

<b>Hunson Abadeer</b>: Marceline!

<b>Teenage Marceline</b>:  [<i>sniffling</i>] Daddy, why?

[<i>Finn and Jake enter a new memory located in the <a href="/wiki/Tree_Fort" title="Tree Fort">Tree Fort</a></i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  It's our treehouse. This must be when Marceline lived here.

[<i>A slightly younger Marceline and Ash carry and put down chair in the room They fall on the chair</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  I'm so glad we're doing this, <a href="/wiki/Ash" title="Ash">Ash</a>.

<b>Ash</b>:  Yeah, me too. Oh, hey, wait. Watch this--I've been practicing. [<i>summons rose</i>]

<b>Rose</b>:  Marceline! I love, I love.

[<i>Marceline kisses Ash on the cheek; rose continues to say "I love"</i>]

<b>Ash</b>:  [<i>giggles</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Who's this guy supposed to be?

<b>Finn</b>:  Ash, I guess.

[<i>Finn and Jake enter a new room through a mouse hole to see Marceline sitting in a chair</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>sighs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>sniffs</i>] This place reeks.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yo, man, your thing is glowing.

<b>Finn</b>:  My what? [<i>touches forehead</i>] Oh, my thing.

<b>Jake</b>:  We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on.

<b>Finn</b>:  Wait a sec, Jake. It's that guy again.

<b>Ash</b>:  Hey, open your eyes, look at this, Mar-Mar. Check it out. It's my new wand. [<i>holds a flower with four cherry blossoms</i>] These cherry blossoms, look, look as close as you can, and they're real.

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>puts a finger near a cherry blossom and gets zapped</i>] Wow. Awesome. Where'd you get the money for that thing?

<b>Ash</b>: Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a <a href="/wiki/Maja" title="Maja">Witch</a>.

<b>Marceline</b>:  You what? Are you crazy? That was my favorite thing in the whole world!

<b>Ash</b>:  That's why it's so valuable, genius--for potions.

[<i>A ghost comes out of the wand</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Cherry_Blossom_Ghost" title="Cherry Blossom Ghost">Cherry Blossom Ghost</a></b>:  You're not, a genius. You're not, a genius.

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>crying</i>] That's the last straw, Ash! That's it! You're a psycho jerk, and you ruined my life.

<b>Ash</b>:  But--but not all of it!

<b>Marceline</b>:  <i><b>IT'S OVER, YOU PSYCHO!!</b></i> [<i>stomps out of the room</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: This way, Finn! Check out this whacked out memory crack! It's ba-nay-nay down here!

[<i>They enter Marceline's memory core</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  The core!

<b>Jake</b>:  All these orbs must be her memories.

<b>Finn</b>:  How are we supposed to know which one to grab?

<b>Jake</b>:  Play hot-cold with your forehead!

<b>Finn</b>:  Alright. [<i>moves along the memory core</i>] Hot or cold?

<b>Jake</b>:  Cold. Definitely cold.

[<i>Finn continues moving</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Warmer. Warmer, warmer! Whoa, hot. Hot, hot, hot! That must be the one!

[<i>Finn grabs memory</i>]

[<i>Finn and Jake wake up with the memory orb in their hand; it gets grabbed by Rag Wizard, who has arms now</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>wakes up</i>] Huh? Hey, you have arms.

<b>Ash</b>:  That's right, genius.

<b>Jake</b>:  Huh?

Finn: You lied to us.

<b>Ash</b>:  The important thing is... Marceline's awake. [<i>magically beams Marceline awake</i>]

[<i>Marceline wakes up</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Marcie, Marcie! You're okay.

[<i>Finn and Jake rub Marceline's hair, Rag Wizard takes off his wardrobe revealing himself to be Ash</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  Quit touching my hair!

<b>Finn</b>:  You had a magic accident, and we saved you with some help from your wizard friend.

<b>Marceline</b>:  That's Ash.

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  Ash?

<b>Marceline</b>:  He's not my friend; he's my <i>boyfriend</i>.

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  What?!

<b>Ash</b>:  That's right, babe.

<b>Marceline</b>:  Ash, what's going on?

<b>Ash</b>:  Just picking up my girl for a night on the town; at my place.

<b>Marceline</b>:  That's sweet. [<i>kisses Ash on the cheek</i>]

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  What?!

<b>Marceline</b>:  Oh, grow up you guys. I'm going to go freshen up.

<b>Ash</b>:  That's a relief.

<b>Marceline</b>:  Oh, Ash.

<b>Finn</b>:  What?

<b>Ash</b>:  Don't you guys get it? I outbrained you. That wasn't the memory of a sleep spell you brought me. That memory was our break-up!

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>in memory orb</i>] <i>It's over, you psycho!!</i> [<i>orb is popped by Ash</i>]

<b>Ash</b>:  That's enough of that?

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, no!

<b>Finn</b>:  What?

<b>Ash</b>:  Yup. Come on, Mar-Mar, let's go.

<b>Finn</b>:  No, Marceline!

<b>Ash</b>:  Ashicus Flyicus. [<i>flies away with Marceline</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  They're gone, man. He took her!

<b>Jake</b>:  Don't worry, Finn! I got the scent. [<i>sniffs</i>] Ah. Follow me.

[<i>Finn and Jake arrive at Ash's house</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  I could smell them in there. So what's the plan?

<b>Finn</b>:  Um. Okay, you take that shovel and keep banging it against that shed until Ash comes out to see what's happening. Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline.

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>fist bumps Finn</i>] Nice. [<i>bangs shovel against shed and <a href="/wiki/Tiny_Goblin" title="Tiny Goblin">Tiny Goblin</a> comes out</i>]

<b>Tiny Goblin</b>:  My house! What's happening? No, don't hurt me!

<b>Jake</b>:  No, no, sorry.

Tiny Goblin: [<i>screams</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Shh, shh, wait!

<b>Tiny Goblin</b>:  Help, somebody help me!

<b>Ash</b>:  [<i>bursting out his front door</i>] What's all this hullabaloo?!

Tiny Goblin: Help! Help!

<b>Ash</b>:  Hey, hold it, you, get back here! [<i>chases after Jake</i>]

[<i>Finn arrives through the house's chimney</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  Finn? Finn, what are you doing? You can't be here! Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals.

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, okay. Sorry Marceline, I'll go. I just gotta show you something first.[<i>shows Marceline sack of magic powder</i>]

[<i>The powder puffs into a big cloud and they are transported to Finn's memories</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  Hello? Finn?

[<i>Marceline opens a door to see a baby Finn singing <a href="/wiki/Baby_Finn_Song" title="Baby Finn Song" class="mw-redirect">Baby Finn Song</a>. She stops watching and starts laughing, Finn shows up</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hey, there you are. [<i>closes door</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>:  Finn, what's going on? What is this place?

<b>Finn</b>:  It's my old house. That magic powder--it put you in my memories. Me and Jake were in yours before, but Ash tricked us into stealing your memory of you breaking up with him. But it's okay because I saw the memory. Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory. See? [<i>holds memory orb to Marceline</i>]

<b>Ash</b>:  [<i>memory orb</i>] Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a witch.

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>in memory orb</i>] <i><b>It's over, you psycho!!</b></i>

<b>Marceline</b>:  Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now.

[<i>Finn and Marceline exit his memories and are walking out of Ash's house</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  You gonna be okay, Marceline?

<b>Marceline</b>:  Yeah. Thanks, Finn, I...

<b>Ash</b>:  Yo, Mar-Mar. What—What's with the chump? C'mon, I said no chumps. [<i>pats his belly</i>] Ash gets hungies at eight o' clock. You need to get back in the kitchen and make me din-ner.

<b>Marceline</b>:  [<i>angrily grunts with a scowl</i>]

<b>Ash</b>:  I want a turkey sandwich with to-ma-to.

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>grunts once more</i>]

<b>Ash</b>:  Also pickles.

[<i>Steaming, Marceline kicks Ash in the crotch, Ash groans in pain. Ash falls down, and Marceline continues to kick him. Finn starts jumping on Ash.</i>]

<b>Ash</b>: [<i>groaning</i>] Ohh...I can't see...Somebody call my mom!
