<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>gasps</i>] He's heading for that cube. Come on, Jake.

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, yeah.

[<i>The Lich enters the time room from a hole on the side. Finn and Jake bound to the time room and enter to find the Lich laughing next to <a href="/wiki/Prismo" title="Prismo">Prismo</a>. He then disappears.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  <b>Whaaaat?!?!</b> He's gone!

<b>Jake</b>:  <i>What</i>?! What happened?!

<b>Prismo</b>:  Hey, hey! Did you guys see that? You know that was a ghost wearing a dead guy? That might be the nastiest thing I've ever seen. Na-na-na-na-nasty! Nasty jazz! Nast-- [<i>Almost like beat boxing</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey, hey! Easy, buddy! That's our friend Billy! He got possessed by the Lich! [<i>Finn looks very sad and Jake puts an arm around him</i>]

<b>Prismo</b>:  Oh! Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean nothin' by it! I mean, I have a lot of nasty friends. My uncle is nasty. I'm basically honorary nasty.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Jake stretches them down to the floor</i>] Do you know where he went? We have to find our friend.

<b>Prismo</b>:  Who knows?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Depressed</i>] Uh. Oh.

<b>Prismo</b>:  Actually, it depends on the wish I granted him.

<b>Finn</b>:  <i>"Wish"?</i> [<i>Hastily</i>]

<b>Prismo</b>:  Yeah, he wished for the extinction of all life and I did it. I guess it changed his timeline or something?

<b>Finn</b>:  <b>WHAT?!?! OH GLOB!</b>

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa, wait a minute. How can that be if I'm still here kickin' it with my main man, Finn?

<b>Prismo</b>:  Oh, that's because you're safe in my time room until you make <i>your</i> wish.

<b>Finn &amp; Jake</b>:  [<i>They pause to think</i>] Ohhhh.

<b>Jake</b>:  I wish that life wasn't anymore extinc—

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Finn pushes Jakes arm down</i>] Whoa! Wait, Jake. Don't mess this up. Think about it: if we wish everything back to normal, the Lich could just jazz it up again.

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh yeah. Jazz.

<b>Finn</b>:  Hmmmm. [<i>Thinking</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hmmmm.

<b>Finn</b>:  I got it! I wish... the Lich... never... even ever existed!

<b>Farmworld Finn</b>:  What! Sell <a href="/wiki/Bartram" title="Bartram">Bartram</a>? [<i>Bartram sits up in the bed in the corner</i>] But, I love Bartram. What the heck, Mom!

But, I bet there's a lot o' fine folk lookin' to buy a good mule. Why, I bet I could even come visit sometimes. Won't that be swell, Bartram? [<i>Looks around and sees that the mule is gone</i>] Bartram? Dang it Bartram! Bar Bar! [<i>Finn walks through some bushes to find Batram in a dead tree</i>] What the- Bar Bar, how'd ya get up there? [<i>sigh</i>] Whoa! [<i>Finn falls through some bushes and into an underground cave. Jake follows.

<b>Farmworld Finn</b>:  Okay, okay! But, um, maybe I could just borrow it for a little while. [<i>Finn reaches for the crown again</i>]

<b>Farmworld Marceline</b>:  Noooo! No! Noo! This crown is magic. Bad, terrible magic. Too dangerous for mortal fingies like yours! [<i>Marceline has a flashback of Simon walking onto a hill to watch a squad of bombers.</i>] One thousand years ago, my beloved friend <a href="/wiki/Simon_Petrikov" title="Simon Petrikov" class="mw-redirect">Simon Petrikov</a> gave his life to save this foolish, unworthy planet from annihilation.

[<i>We see Marceline in the cave again</i>] Today, ever ripe and ready to blow. [<i>We see Farmworld Simon being crushed by the bomb</i>] But he alone was not saved. Trapped under the giant weight of the enormous bomb, poor Simon perished!

<b>Farmworld Marceline</b>:  [<i>Farmworld Simon is seen dead and the crown is firing laser-like beams of energy</i>] And the horrible crown, grieving its lost master, loosed a spasm of magic so wild and crazy the entire earth was buried in ice for four hundred <i>boring</i> years. [<i>First we see a city being frozen almost instantaneously and then we see the earth covered in ice. The flashback ends.</i>]

<b>Farmworld Finn</b>:  Uhh, none o' that is true, 'cause magic is fake. Daddy says the false prophets of old used cheap parlor tricks to control the people. [<i>Farmworld Jake is growling</i>] And to get babes. Like 10 or 12 hot babes each.

<b>Farmworld Marceline</b>:  No! Magic is real!

<b>Farmworld Finn</b>:  Lady! You been down here too long! Why don't you, just let me- [<i>Finn goes for the crown again</i>]

<b>Farmworld Marceline</b>:  Step off! Or I will use this!

<b>Farmworld Marceline</b>:  I know you're not really talking to me. I'm not crazy!

<b>Farmworld Simon</b>:  Get the crown! Go get it!

<b>Farmworld Marceline</b>:  [<i>huff</i>]

<b>Farmworld Simon</b>:  Get the crown, Marceline! Go get it!

<b>Farmworld Marceline</b>:  I can't. My knees!

<b>Farmworld Simon</b>:  Oh, that's really disappointing I must say. I'm just—uh, whatever, you're really letting me down right now.

<b>Farmworld Marceline</b>:  Okay, alright. [<i>farts</i>]

<b>Big Destiny</b>:  Snap! Huh? What is this? [<i>He turns around</i>] Are you tellin' me what to wear, Trami?

<b>Trami</b>:  No, boss, you look good! [<i>He is sweating</i>]

<b>Trami</b>:  No, man! You tell <i>us</i> what to wear!

<b>Farmworld Finn</b>:  Wha?

<b>Big Destiny</b>:  That is your final possession, the last thing you will ever own.

<b>Farmworld Finn</b>:  What do you…mean? [<i>He walks over to the window with Big D</i>]

<b>Big Destiny</b>:  Look down there, stupid.
