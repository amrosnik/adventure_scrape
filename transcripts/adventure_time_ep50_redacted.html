[<i>The episode begins at the Candy Hospital. A crowd is hovering over <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a> as she's pushed on a gurney.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Nurse_Pound_Cake" title="Nurse Pound Cake">Nurse Pound Cake</a></b>:  What's her condition, <a href="/wiki/Dr._Ice_Cream" title="Dr. Ice Cream">Dr. Ice Cream</a>?

<b>Dr. Ice Cream</b>:  She's totally gross over 90% of her body. The other 10% is crazy nasty.

<b>Nurse Pound Cake</b>:  Will she make it, Doctor?

<b>Dr. Ice Cream</b>:  [<i>Gravely</i>] I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake. [<i>They quickly pull her to the emergency room, a heart monitor bleeps.</i>] Put sugar on 'er! Two scoops! [<i>She and Nurse Pound Cake each put two handfuls of sugar on her, but she starts flat-lining.</i>] We're losing 'er!!

<b><a href="/wiki/Ice_King" title="Ice King">Ice King</a></b>:  No! Not my number one! Princess, if you die on me, I will never forgive you! I'll be lost—lost in my own emotional labyri—

<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>:  [<i>Furiously punches him</i>] YAAAAAH!!

<b>Dr. Ice Cream</b>:  Wait, Finn!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Scared</i>] What!?

<b>Dr. Ice Cream</b>:  Her sugar levels are stabilizing.

[<i>Princess Bubblegum regains her normal body shape. Everyone starts cheering. "Yaaay! She's alright!"</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Drained</i>] Yes, I'm fine. I just need to rest.

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Crying</i>] Oh, my wife! Is there anything weird about her? I can't see through these pain tears!

<b>Dr. Ice Cream</b>:  She's fine. Why?

<b>Ice King</b>:  It's just that... after Princess fell into the well, I saw something strange happen. Something I still don't understand. [<i>Finn's Root Sword is hurled at Ice King.</i>] Ooh—AGH! Wait! Listen to me!!

<b>Finn</b>:  NO! Just shut your <i>mouth</i>, old man!

<b>Ice King</b>:  "Old man?" Heh! What? I'm not old.

<b><a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></b>:  Uh, yeah, you are, dude.

[<i>Everyone agrees with Jake. "You are pretty old." "Yes, you are." "You're old."</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Old? I'm... I see. It's all making sense now. Brrrrapapo! [<i>Blasts window with ice magic, shattering it</i>] I'm going, Princess. I'm sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess. [<i>Tearing up</i>] Nobody in the world.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>With rage</i>] JUST GET <i>OUT</i> OF HERE!!

<b>Ice King</b>:  Peace.

[<i>He makes a peace sign then exits while waving solemnly. Finn sighs.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Sorry about that, Peebles.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  The ice wizard is a weak fool....

<b>Jake</b>:  Huh?

<b>Raggedy Princess</b>:  [<i>Running in</i>] Finn! Finn! The other princesses and I made you a new <a href="/wiki/Finn%27s_pack" title="Finn's pack">backpack</a>!

<b>Finn</b>:  Whoa, Raggedy Princess! It's so awesome! Thank you.

<b>Raggedy Princess</b>:  [<i>Blushes</i>] You're welcome, Finn! [<i>Giggles and runs off</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>To Princess Bubblegum.</i>] You look like sick, grey meat, but we're gonna jack you up so awesome.

<b>Finn</b>:  We should wheel 'er to her bedroom, right?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, man, and then we'll do magic tricks.

[<i>Princess Bubblegum closes her eyes.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Like <i>fake</i> magic?

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, like [<i>Jake's voice trails off as the screen turns black.</i>] bruh bruh bruh, bruh...

[<i>Scene shifts to Princess Bubblegum's bedroom.</i>]

<b>Finn and Jake</b>:  Princess... Princess... [<i>Princess Bubblegum opens her eyes.</i>] Surprise!

<b>Finn</b>:  We picked every flower in the Candy Kingdom just for you! [<i>The flowers lie in the room, piling half-way up the wall in some places.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoo-oo!

[<i>She says nothing.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Princess Bubblegum?

[<i>She makes a strange guttural noise and irregularly bends her body.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, <i>jeez</i>!! [<i>He hides behind Finn.</i>] What's wrong with Princess Bubblegum?!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>whispering</i>] Quiet, dude. We're supposed to take care of her, not make her feel bad!

<b>Jake</b>:  I know, man, but she just seems... <i>weird</i>.

<b>Finn</b>:  She's just messed up from the accident, man. We just have to take care of her 'til she feels better.

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh... Okay, dude.

[<i>They look at the bed and gasp; she's gone. Sounds are heard from the bathroom. They go there.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Princess! Princess, no! You shouldn't be out of bed! [<i>Finn picks her up and carries her back.</i>] Princess... I... I gotta tell ya somethin'. Uh... Jake... [<i>He nudges his head slightly to signal Jake to get out.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh. Gotcha. I'll go get some tea! [<i>He cuts his way through the pile of flowers and exits.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Princess... this sweater you made me kept me safe. I almost got super messed up, but... it saved me. And I wanted to say... thank you for imbuing this sweater with the power of liking someone a lot. Because... I like you a lot. [<i>Princess Bubblegum is looking at him.</i>] [<i>Finn blushes</i>] Haha, uh... We shouldn't talk about this now. You should rest.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Weakly</i>] Finn... I need you to get me some things...

<b>Finn</b>:  Yes, Princess.

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>:  [<i>Entering with Jake</i>] Princess! I brought you some tea—[<i>He gasps, dropping the tea and sees Princess Bubblegum talking to Finn. He hisses like a cat.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Whoa... [<i>Peppermint Butler runs away on all fours.</i>] Uh... somethin' weird's goin' on...

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>approaches Jake from behind.</i>] Jake!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Startled</i>] AH!

<b>Finn</b>:  I'm gonna get some stuff for PB. Be right back.

[<i>Jake makes a worried noise. He turns and looks at the princess who is breathing deeply and creepily.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Somewhat scared</i>] Hey... Princess... Sorry you're not feelin' good. [<i>She says nothing and looks at him annoyed (still breathing deeply).</i>] Oh! I'll sing you a song! You love it when I sing songs!

[<i>Jake grabs a pink microphone and small speaker, and forms bongos on his stomach, beginning to sing <a href="/wiki/Not_Feelin%27_Good_Song" title="Not Feelin' Good Song">his song</a>. Princess Bubblegum is visibly annoyed and suddenly has a deeper voice. She growls and puts her hand in a bush, wilting every single flower in the room.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Uh... [<i>Princess Bubblegum convulses and yells gibberish.</i>] Uh, this song's not that good. It's a bad one. I... I'm stoppin'. [<i>She yells again.</i>] ...And starting a <i>new</i> song! [<i>Plays bongos</i>] [<i>Princess Bubblegum yells in utter agitation. Her bed begins jumping up and down. Suddenly, demonic flames engulf the room.</i>] AAH... [<i>Princess Bubblegum touches him</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>apparently melting.</i>] Jake...

<b>Jake</b>:  AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!! [<i>Flees room</i>] OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY <i><b>GLOB!!</b></i> [<i>To himself</i>] Maybe the toxic waste did somethin' to her brain—made her have demon powers—or <i>somethin’</i>! [<i>Finn runs towards the bedroom door with paraphernalia in his arms.</i>] Yo, dude! Wait! What's all <i>that</i> biz?!

<b>Finn</b>:  Uh, bleach, lighter fluid, ammonia, gasoline, I dunno. Lady stuff. Plutonium...

[<i>Princess Bubblegum exits the room.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  No, man... no... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Grabbing ingredients</i>] Thanks. [<i>Goes back in</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  No probs!

<b>Jake</b>:  Wait! Hold on!

<b>Finn</b>:  What's up?

<b>Jake</b>:  Listen... PB's bed was on <i>fire</i>.

<b>Finn</b>:  What?! Is she okay?!

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Whispering</i>] She <i>made it</i> on fire.

<b>Finn</b>:  With a match?

<b>Jake</b>:  No, man. With her brain... I think... [<i>Finn stares confused.</i>] Look, man, I'll show you!

<b>Finn</b>:  Jake, wh—

<b>Jake</b>:  Shh!! [<i>Jake carefully opens the door. The room is burnt to a crisp, and Princess Bubblegum is gone.</i>] P-P-P-Princess...?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Pointing to bathroom</i>] Over there! [<i>They go in front of the door. Finn knocks.</i>] PB? You in there?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Threateningly</i>] I'm <i>busy</i>!

<b>Finn</b>:  See? It's fine. She's just havin' private time.

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm lookin' in! [<i>Looks through keyhole</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  JAKE, WHAT THE <i>HEY</i>?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Oh, my <i>glob</i>!

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>blushing.</i>] Come on, man, that's <i>pervy</i>!

<b>Jake</b>:  You don't even <i>know</i>, man.

<b>Finn</b>:  DUDE?!

<b>Jake</b>:  Look! [<i>Jake forces Finn to look through the keyhole.</i>] See it!

[<i>Princess Bubblegum's skin is now black, and her shape has changed tremendously. She's putting the ingredients from before into the tub and drinking it.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Hold on, Peebles! [<i>He smashes down the door.</i>] PRINCESS! [<i>She grows bigger as she drinks the chemicals. She then picks up the whole bath tub and drinks deeply.</i>] AAH! PUT DOWN THE TUB!

[<i>She throws it down and knocks Finn and Jake through a wall. Ice King is revealed to have been listening in. Princess Bubblegum smashes her way out of the castle.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Gumball_Guardian" title="Gumball Guardian">Gumball Guardian</a></b>:  Evil presence detected!! [<i>Grapples with monster Princess Bubblegum</i>] Must defend!!

[<i>Back at the Candy Castle</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>poking Finn's face.</i>] Hey, Finn, are you dead or what?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Waking up</i>] Whaaah?... Ice King? What are <i>you</i> doing here?

<b>Ice King</b>:  Hey. I had to keep an eye on the princess because she's being possessed by the Lich.

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Grunts</i>] You don't know that.

<b>Ice King</b>:  But I do. I saw it with my <a href="/wiki/Wizard_Eyes" title="Wizard Eyes">wizard eyes</a>! [<i>Scene changes to the well.</i>] In the well, I saw something come out of the Lich and go into the princess. But I wasn't sure it was real [<i>scene returns to normal.</i>] because when you have stanky old wizard eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it's like crazy crazy crazy in your face all the time! [<i>Strange creatures dance around Finn and Jake in the Ice King's vision. He sighs</i>] [<i>To himself</i>] All the time... [<i>To the duo</i>] Guys, let me help you. I don't want my future wife to be... physically unattractive.

<b>Finn</b>:  Listen, you old poot. I'm not going to let you kill 'er twice. GET <i>STUFFED</i>. Come on, Jake.

[<i>Ice King groans in sadness as they exit.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  We're coming, Princess!

<b>Jake</b>:  Dude! I think we should let the Ice King help! He can freeze her, which could buy us some t—

<b>Finn</b>:  Dump <i>that</i> mess! I'mma set 'er free with my like-like sweater!

<b>Jake</b>:  Woooh, do it! [<i>Propels Finn towards her with his hind end.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>while hurtling through the air.</i>]I like you, Princess!!

[<i>Princess Bubblegum punches Finn, who screams.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Finn!!

[<i>Finn is knocked back to the castle, next to a forlorn Ice King.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Urrgh... [<i>To himself</i>] Liking her... didn't <i>work</i>. She's unstoppable... unless... [<i>He sees her stomping on Jake's head and sighs.</i>] [<i>Reluctantly</i>] Ice King, I... I need you to freeze Princess Bubblegum. Will you help me?

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] Are you suuuuure?

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Annoyed</i>] Yes.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Great! Weeee! [<i>Laughs and grabs Finn before exiting</i>]

[<i>They fly towards her.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I'll distract 'er up top, you freeze 'er legs!

<b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Throwing Finn</i>] Wah!

<b>Finn</b>:  I'M A CAT! I'M AN AGILE CAT! JAKE! DUCK! [<i>Jake retracts his body and falls to the ground. Finn grabs Princess Bubblegum's hair and covers her face with it.</i>] MEOW, ICE KING! [<i>Ice King grunts as he freezes the monstrosity with visible difficulty. A bird brings Finn down to the ground before he's frozen.</i>] Thanks, bird!

[<i>The Candy People gather around and cheer.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Yeah! Whoopie!

<b>Finn</b>:  You did good, Ice King.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, yeah?

<b>Finn</b>:  Yeah, man.

[<i>Suddenly, Princess Bubblegum topples over and her body is totally shattered. Finn looks at Jake, who both have  a look of utter and total shock and horror.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>:  Okay. I didn't kill 'er this time. Everybody saw that, right?

<b>Gumball Guardian</b>:  [<i>shattered.</i>] Duuuude...

<b>Finn</b>:  We gotta get 'er to the hospital!

[<i>Scene shifts back to the hospital.</i>]

<b>Dr. Ice Cream</b>:  Start assembling! Here, try to connect these two pieces! [<i>The pieces don't connect.</i>] Turn it... [<i>The wads of gum stick.</i>] Perfect. [<i>The wad of gum is put on Princess Bubblegum's head to make a piece of her hair.</i>] Give me more pieces, <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Princess" title="Doctor Princess">Doctor Princess</a>!

<b>Dr. Princess</b>:  That's all we have, Dr. Ice Cream!

<b>Dr. Ice Cream</b>:  What?! That can't be!

<b>Nurse Pound Cake</b>:  [<i>Gasps</i>] What do we do, Doctor?

<b>Dr. Ice Cream</b>:  [<i>sighing</i>] ...I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake.

[<i>Outside the emergency room, everyone is chattering.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  I hope she's okay...

<b>Nurse Pound Cake</b>:  Attention, everyone...

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>In desperation</i>] <b>IS PB OKAY?!?</b>

<b>Nurse Pound Cake</b>:  Yes... but there were some complications.

<b>Finn</b>:  NOOOOOOO!!!!

<b>Nurse Pound Cake</b>:  Yes... I'm afraid... there wasn't enough gum to work with, so it appears Princess Bubblegum is now...... younger. [<i>A young Princess Bubblegum steps out of the emergency room. Everyone gasps, astonished.</i>] She's 13 years old now.

<b>Ice King</b>:  Aw, dang it! Well, I'm outta here. Goodbye, everyone. [<i>Exits</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  13 years old? That's how old <i>I</i> am. [<i>Princess Bubblegum smiles at Finn. He blushes.</i>] Uh...

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Amused</i>] Whoa...

[<i>She walks up to him.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  [<i>Embracing him</i>] Give me a hug, hero.

[<i>Everyone cheers. Finn embraces her. Suddenly the camera pans menacingly past the crowd and reveals the waving <a href="/wiki/Snail" title="Snail">snail</a>—possessed by the Lich. The story ends.</i>]
