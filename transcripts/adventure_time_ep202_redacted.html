[<i>The episode begins with King of Ooo showing Finn and Jake a surveillance video (while they sit on tiny stools) of a flying mushroom shot in the Candy Kingdom</i>]

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: [<i>Pointing to screen</i>] There. Right there. See?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Squinting</i>] Uhhh...Yeah. It's a small thing?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Moves uncomfortably</i>] Hey, do you have bigger chairs?

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: [<i>Glares</i>] Stools.

<b>Jake</b>: Huh?

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: [<i>Walking toward Jake</i>] They're stools; not chairs.

<b>Jake</b>: Well can I have a bigger stool, then?

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: Jake, stop interrupting!

<b>Jake</b>: Sorry.

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: Enhance!

<b>Banana Guards</b>: [<i>Push Finn and Jake while on the stools much closer to the TV</i>]

<b>Finn and Jake</b>: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa!

<b>Jake</b>: Looks like a mushroom. Someone throwing mushrooms?

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: Yes, very good, it is a mushroom! Or a toadstool. That's why you're sitting on stools.

<b>Finn and Jake</b>: [<i>simultaneously</i>] Oh.

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: See, you guys gotta trust me on this one, okay? I picked those stools for a reason. Trust my process! You can get up now.

<b>Finn and Jake</b>: [<i>get up and crack their backs</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: My legs.

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: No, nobody's throwing mushrooms. [<i>moves closer to the TV</i>] I believe they're flying on their own. That's where you two come in.

[<i>Finn, Jake, King Of Ooo, and two Banana Guards walk toward where the flying mushroom was shown</i>]

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: Okay, the flying mushroom came from that direction, [<i>points in direction flying mushroom came from</i>] so I want you two to head that way until you find one. A big one. and I want you to capture it, and bring it back.

<b>Jake</b>: Why?

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: Huh?

<b>Jake</b>: Why?

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: [<i>leans toward Finn and Jake</i>] Trust my process.

<b>Jake</b>: Okay, but why, though?

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, we're curious.

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: I wanna ride it around instead of walking. I think people will respect me more. [<i>Dirt Beer Guy walks by in background</i>] Hey. Hey, you, what's your name?

<b>Dirt Beer Guy</b>: I'm Dirt Beer Guy.

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: What would you think if you saw me on a giant flying mushroom? Dirt Beer Guy

<b>King Of Ooo</b>: See? Don't fail on this one, boys. [<i>threateningly</i>] Don't you dare fail me.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Walking through forest with Jake</i>] Actually, I'm kinda glad we're walking in this direction. We never walk in this direction.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Stops walking, faces Finn</i>] Hey, how long do you think capturin' a flyin' mushroom takes?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Removing backpack</i>] Well we gotta find one first. [<i>Reaches in pack for something</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, that too. How long?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Takes out water bottle, drains about a quarter of it, wipes mouth</i>] Mm. An hour to capture, aaand, if we don't find him by dinner, we'll tell KOO to send out a Banana Guard patrol.

<b>Jake</b>: Tell who?

<b>Finn</b>: KOO.

<b>Jake</b>: ...King Of Ooo?

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah.

<b>Finn and Jake</b>: [<i>Laugh, continue to walk</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Did you notice he was wearing Princess Bubblegum's clothes?

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, that was sorta cool. But you know, PB just left her kingdom to 'im. And all her stuff, so what's that about?

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Sniffs, stops, nose and mouth stretch out forward and sniffs for something, turns around</i>] I smell mushrooms.

<b>Finn and Jake</b>: [<i>Run up a hill dotted with mushrooms</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, good job, Jake.

<b>Jake</b>: Check it out. [<i>points to a relatively large mushroom</i>] Big enough for KOO's tiny heiny!

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, the only thing, though, is it's not flying.

<b>Jake</b>: Mmm, yeah... [<i>Finn and Jake look around for a bit</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: I guess we could just sit here... and wait for it to fly?
