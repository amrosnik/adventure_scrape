<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh, that's Braco, a suitor of mine.

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, cool. That's cool—you're dating, that's coool. See ya, Princess.

[<i>The scene now goes to Finn and Jake whose now walking away from the Candy Kingdom.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What'd ya think of that Braco guy? I mean, he seems kinda weird [<i>Faces Jake</i>] and passive and baby lambish [<i>Jake panics and is trying to tell Finn that Braco is behind them</i>] and too unheroic for Peebs. [<i>Looks behind him and is shocked</i>] And then I smashed that peach!

<b>Braco</b>: [<i>On his knees</i>] Jake and Finn, I seek your aid. I need to ask you for that map, therewith I can bring the soul stone to Bubblegum. Then she'll love me!

<b>Finn</b>: That road you're on leads to nowhere. [<i>Hands the map to Braco</i>]

<b>Braco</b>: Oddsbodikins! [<i>Jumps in the fire pit</i>] AHHHHH!

[<i>As Braco got the key and got out, he has a big burn mark on his face, both hands and feet, and mostly bald and injured.</i>

<b>Braco</b>: [<i>Removes the cloth on his face</i>] Uhhh. [<i>Happily looks at the key</i>]

[<i>The next scene is where Braco was walking to find the soul stone. As he is walking, a person suddenly opens his eyes as Braco walks past him. Braco makes it to where the soul stone is hidden.</i>]

<b>Braco</b>: [<i>Unlocks the seal of where the soul stone it hidden</i>] The soul stone. This journey has come to an end. [<i>Grabs the soul stone and produces a bright light</i>]

[<i>As the light fades away, the guardians of the soul stone appear and attack him, but misses and hit the other guardian instead</i>]

<b>Guardian #1</b>: AHHHHHH! YOU BROKE MY HANDS!

[<i>The other guardian, who broke the guardian's hand, attacks Braco once more and hits him, which sends him flying towards a rock.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Hmmm.

<b>Braco</b>: [<i>Covers PB's eyes</i>] Guess who.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Braco. Ehhh, what happened to you?

<b>Braco</b>: Oh, look, can it be? [<i>Pretends to grab the soul stone from PB's hair</i>] It's a soul stone!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh, yeah, sorry, but I don't need that anymore. I just finished programming a proper simulation of a soul. In fact, this is much easier to manipulate than a real one. [<i>turns to see that Braco is gone</i>] Braco?

[<i>The scene goes to Braco, who is writing on his personal diary.</i>]

<b>Braco</b>: Hmmm, [<i>Puts the pen on his diary and closes it. And then he grabs a hammer as he breaks the soul stone, out of which a soul escapes, throws his diary and his teapot off the table, and breaks his ink jar</i>] WHY WON'T SHE LOVE ME?! [<i>A Gumball Guardian grabs him through the window</i>] Ahhh!

[<i>The scene goes again to Peppermint Butler, who is still talking to Ogdoad.</i>]

<b>Ogdoad</b>: Set me free, you tranch!

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Give me the key to the shadow realm!

<b>Braco</b>: Ahhhh!

<b>Gumball Guardian</b>: You said you were going to handle this. You are doing a bad job.

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Alright, I got this. Peace. [<i>The Gumball Guardian leaves</i>] What's up, man? PB is not in to you?

<b>Braco</b>: Yeah, man, I'm throwing the towel.

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Whoa, come on. PB's a tough nut, but don't trip out.

<b>Braco</b>: Then you must help me... to crack the nut. [<i>Lies down</i>]

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: No problem, man. [<i>Sits on his body</i>] We'll use magic, <i>shadow demon</i> magic!

<b>Ogdoad</b>: Say what?

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: For your freedom, a spell.

<b>Ogdoad</b>: Yes.

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Make this man-noodle Braco into a walking love magnet!

<b>Ogdoad</b>: [<i>Evil laugh</i>] He he he he, this I can do, but can you pay the price, Braco?

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: The price is your freedom, man.

<b>Ogdoad</b>: This price lies outside of our arrangement. To receive, you must pay!

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Hmmm, alright, well, maybe no dark magic. [<i>Ogdoad laughing in the backround</i>]

<b>Braco</b>: I'll pay any price... for love!

<b>Ogdoad</b>: [<i>Continues to laugh and blasts him with a dark magic spell</i>] SWAZAA!

<b>Braco</b>: Waaahhh! [<i>Began to transform</i>].

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Release!

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Uhhh, who's that? Huh, what?

<b>Braco</b>: [<i>Makes groaning noises and his voice and appearance changes like he and a demon combined</i>] Am I a walking love magnet?

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Well, you paid the price, no doubt, and I wanna have your babies.

<b>Braco</b>: To the princess, then! [<i>Leaves the tree</i>]

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: No, wait! What about meee?!

[<i>The scene goes to PB where she is talking and asking some questions to a robot that look like her she made.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum Bot</b>: Uh, yeah, who should I date?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: There's a guy named Braco who's really nice.

<b>Princess Bubblegum Bot</b>: Ooh, where is he?

<b>Braco</b>: I'm here!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Braco? What happened to you?!

<b>Braco</b>: I paid the price for love, was it worth it? Do you love me?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Yes, I love you.

<b>Braco</b>: Then marry me! We'll travel the world, have adventures, make the babes, get fat and weird, and float up to <a href="/wiki/50th_Dead_World" title="50th Dead World" class="mw-redirect">50th Dead World</a>, right?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Oh, Braco, I don't want any of that mess. I <i>do</i> love you, but it's the undifferentiated love I feel for all candy citizens. I couldn't permit one of my citizens to suffer the way I saw you suffering over me. And so I made you this. Meet my doppelganger, P-Bot.

[<i>P-Bot stands up</i>]

<b>Braco</b>: Uhhh, this feels super-wrong.

<b>Princess Bubblegum Bot</b>: Oh, Braco, [<i>Kisses him on the cheek</i>] let's get out of this smelly lab.

<b>Braco</b>: [<i>Excited</i>] Okay! [<i>Carries P-bot and ran away to the balcony</i>] Thank you, Princess! [<i>Jumps over the balcony</i>] Woohoo!

<b>Princess Bubblegum Bot</b>: Woohoo!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: You're welcome, my love [<i>Drops a tear</i>].

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: [<i>Suddenly shows up when the Gumball Guardian puts him near PB</i>] Where is he? Where's Braco?!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I let him go, Peps. I knew he couldn't be happy without me so I built him a robo-wife.

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: You should have given him to me! [<i>Slaps her</i>]
