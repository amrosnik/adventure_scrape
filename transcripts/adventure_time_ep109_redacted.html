<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>Jake freaks out and collects all of the pups into his arms</i>] We were just wrestling! Cool uncle wrestling.

<b>Jake</b>:  Um, ah, I-I think it's gettin' kinda late. Um, puppies need sleep.

<b>Finn</b>:  Okay. [<i>Finn doesn't get the hint</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Lady kicks Jake forward</i>] Uhhh, Finn, you should go home. I'm gonna live with Lady and the pups from now on. I'm a dad now. It's a pretty big whoop. [<i>Jake takes Lady's hand and she blushes</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh. [<i>Finn looks disappointed</i>]

[<i>Scene changes to nighttime; Jake is watching the pups with binoculars while holding a sword. He looks at the clock to see the time change to 4:17 AM. He is exhausted</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>yawns</i>] Breakfast time. [<i>He gets up to go make breakfast</i>]

<b>Lady</b>:  자기 지금 뭐 하는거야... ("What are you doing, honey?")

<b>Jake</b>:  Sorry honey, I'm on guard duty. [<i>Jake pets Lady's nose</i>] You're sleepin' for both of us tonight. [<i>Jake goes and looks and the pups and proceeds into the kitchen. He brings out the holo-message player and plays Mom's manual.</i>] [<i>Quietly</i>] Breakfast ideas for pups. [<i>message begins playing</i>]

<b>Holo-<a href="/wiki/Margaret" title="Margaret">Margaret</a></b>:  [<i>While playing, Jake grabs the ingredients</i>] Recipe for french toast. Ingredients: butter, three large eggs, a wide dash of vanilla, milk, ten slices of bread-white, brown, multi-grain, or country loaf. In a large mixing bowl crack the eggs and whisk the milk, vanilla, and all eggs and honey. [<i>While Jake talks to himself</i>] When your consistency is satisfactory, set mixture aside. Dip bread in the mixture and soak thoroughly. Heat your oven to a high heat and sauté your egg soaked bread slices till golden and toasted and serve hot with sugar, cinnamon sugar, jam, ice cream, meat, whipped cream-

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake goes to check on the pups.</i>] Hmm. [<i>He pokes T.V., picks up his arm, and drops it]. </i>Kinda like a dead person. [<i>Returns to kitchen to cook</i>] They're just asleep. It's okay. Ya gotta be a tough dad. [<i>Slams the egg he was cracking onto the counter and knocks over the bowl</i>] AAAAHHHH! [<i>into holo-message player</i>] The puppies aren't moving!

<b>Holo-Margaret</b>:  Perform CPR, they might be dead!

<b>Jake</b>:  AHHHH! [<i>Jake stretches over to the pups and does shoddy CPR on Charlie. The pups wake up annoyed and groaning</i>] Saved 'em! Mom's manual knows best!

[<i>Scene chages to daytime. The pups are playing with each other on the floor and Jake gathers them up and puts them on the couch</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  You guys are getting big! Okay! [<i>yawns</i>] Excuse me. Mom's manual suggests that I read you guys a story. [<i>Pulls out "<a href="/wiki/Baby_Eating_Fox_and_the_Babies" title="Baby Eating Fox and the Babies">Baby Eating Fox and the Babies</a>"</i>] This was your daddy's favorite book when he was cute like you! [<i>Where his name, "Jake" is on the book he adds " 's beautiful puppies" and begins to read. The pups look anxious and look forward to the book. Half way through, he begins to hesitate.</i>]



<b>Jake</b>:  This is a lot darker than I remember! Um, gimme a sec. [<i>Jake has realized how morbid the book is and goes to consult the manual</i>] Is this appropriate for babies?

<b>Holo-Margaret</b>:  [<i>gasps</i>] Get that book out of here!

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, okay. Sorry sweeties, Mom's manual says no. [<i>T.V. throws a rubber duck at Jake's hat. Jake molds his head to form a new one</i>]

<b>Lady</b>:  자기야, 애들 데리고 나가서 바람좀 쐬고 오지 그래? ("Hey honey, why don't you go outside and have some fresh air with the kids?")

<b>Jake</b>:  Take 'em out for fresh air huh? [<i>He stretches to look outside</i>] There m- there might be a giant fox out there. [<i>falls asleep</i>] Or some-some other predator. [<i>wakes up</i>] Hey! [<i>The pups were reading the book and Jake snatched it away</i>] This's not for babies! [<i>He throws the book out the window and it lands next to a sleeping fox</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Mr._Fox" title="Mr. Fox">Mr. Fox</a></b>:  [<i>wakes up</i>] Hey, free book.

[<i>Mr. Fox returns to the foxes' collective home and shows them the book</i>]

<b>Mr. Fox</b>:  Hey! Hey everybody look! Look at this book I found about eating babies! [<i>fox walla</i>] They just sit there while you eat them. [<i>Shows a picture of the baby walking into the fox's mouth</i>]

<b>Fox #1</b>:  Whoa! Eatin' babies.

<b>Fox #2</b>:  Why haven't we been eating babies this whole time? [<i>coughs out the rock it was eating</i>]

<b>Mr. Fox</b>:  I don't know, but I'm going to go eat one right now. [<i>fox walla</i>]

[<i>Jake has the pups on leashes for a walk through he woods</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Okay everyone, your mom wanted me to take y'all out side. [<i>T.V. reaches for a flower, but is pulled back</i>] Ah ah ah, be careful. [<i>Charlie flies up to catch a butterfly, but is pulled down</i>] No Charlie, no. Too much germs, you know? [<i>The butterfly glances back in response to being called "germy"</i>] Everybody just stick together and don't do anything and we can all take a nap.

[<i>The pups are disgruntled and when Jake falls asleep, they all teleport out of their leashes</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Then- [<i>Jake walks into a spiky branch</i>] Ah! Uh! [<i>opens his eyes to find Jake Jr. playing with a rust sword, Kil Whan putting various mushrooms on his nose, Charlie dancing with a frog, T.V. swinging on a branch, and Viola in a tree</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  AHHHH! OH MY GLOOB! No! NoOoOoO! IT'S EVERY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE! NO! No! Noo! [<i>Jake scrambles to catch his pups as they run away like it's a game</i>] Put that down! Get outta there! Ah, come back! Wait T.V., you're gonna hurt yourself! Charlie, nooooo! Viola, wait!

<b>Lady</b>:  [<i>Lady sees them through the window</i>] 얘들아! 비올라! 제이크 2세! 그만해! 찰리! 김길환! 아빠 좀 고만 괴롭히고 안에 들어와! ("Hey kids! Viola! Jake Jr.! Stop it! Charlie! Kim Kil-Whan! Stop messing with daddy and go inside!")

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Lady comes down to see Jake</i>] Hey Lady. These puppies are really wearing me out, you know? I can hardly keep my eyes open.

<b>Lady</b>:  제이크, 자기 혼자 난리치는 거야. 우리 애들 걱정 안 해도 돼. 자기가 너무 과잉보호라니까. ("Jake, you're getting obsessed just all by yourself. Our kids have nothing to worry about. You're being overprotective.")

<b>Jake</b>:  No, no it's- it's all in the manual you see- it's- it-it's got a fe- [<i>falls asleep</i>]

<b>Lady</b>:  아이야이야. 필요 없을 때만 난리라니까. ("Ai yai yai! He makes a fuss whenever it's not necessary.")

<b>Fox #3</b>:  [<i>The foxes are eyeing Jake from the bushes</i>] Is that a baby? It doesn't look right. Why's he so sweaty. And hairy.

<b>Mr. Fox</b>:  Look, fellas, there's never gonna be a perfect baby. Times like this ya just gotta dive right in. [<i>The foxes move in</i>]

<b>Lady</b>:  Goochy goochy goo! [<i>Playing with Viola</i>] 아, 얘들아, 가서 아빠 좀 도와드려라. [<i>Ew, kids, go and give daddy a hand.</i>] [<i>Lady sees the foxes drag Jake away through the window</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  What the- What are you doing?! Let me go! [<i>struggles in vain</i>] Hold on, hold on a minute. Just- just lemme- Y'all better watch out! [<i>Tries to stretch, but is too tired. He looks up and sees the pups flying towards him</i>] Puppies?! What are you doing?! Go back inside! The manual's gonna flip!

<b>Jake Jr.</b>: Dad! The manual's a buncha <i>junk!</i> Just give us a chance.

<b>Jake</b>:  Jake Jr.! You said your first words! "The manual's a buncha junk!" ... The manual's a buncha junk? Hmm. [<i>Flashback begins. Margaret is protecting Jake from a cobra in front of a butcher's shop</i>]

<b>Flashback Margaret</b>:  Stay back Jakey, my manual says it's too dangerous. [<i>Holding holomanual that is freaking out (it's all it can do anyway)</i>]

<b>Flashback Jake</b>:  Mom. Your manual's a buncha junk! Look what I can do! [<i>Flexing his mutant powers' muscle (and his independence), Jake gives the cobra an extra-large knuckle sandwich and laughs</i>]

<b>Flashback Margaret</b>:  Oh... dear... glob! [<i>Flashback ends</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  I'm sorry for being such a little stinker kids. Come on and show the old man watcha got!

<b>Pups</b>:  수학! ("Mathematical!") [<i>The pups crash into the ground and form a Super Pup</i>] 아빠 몸체이동! [<i>Move Dad into body!")</i>

<b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Jake is beamed into the middle of the super pup</i>] Whoa! What the-

<b>Pups</b>:  무지개 뱅! ("Rainbow Bang!") [<i>The pups blast the foxes to temporarily blind them</i>] 프리즘 TBA 작동! ("Initiate prism cyclone!") [<i>They spin like a spinning top, throwing and zapping the foxes</i>]

<b>Jake Jr.</b>:  [<i>The super pup disassembles</i>] Ya see, dad? We flippin' crushed it. <b>Crushed</b> it!

<b>Jake</b>:  You did! I'm super proud y'all and I'm duper sorry too. [<i>Gathers the pups in his arms</i>] I've been tryin' to make you know about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.

<b>Lady</b>:  [<i>Lady flies up excited</i>] 애기들아! 참 잘했어! 너네 정말 대단했어! ("Well done, babies! You were awesome!")

<b>Jake</b>:  Yup! I've been tryin' to make them about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.

[<i>BMO sings the "<a href="/wiki/Bread_Song" title="Bread Song">Bread Song</a>." BMO is dancing and singing on Finn's stomach while holding bread all the while Finn has BMO's controller in his mouth tapping out a beat and laughing</i>]

<b>Jake</b>:  Hey guys. I'm back. [<i>walks up the stairs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>:  [<i>BMO and Finn look over concernedly</i>] Is everything okay?

<b>BMO</b>:  Did you ruin it?

<b>Jake</b>:  Nah, nah, it's cool. It turns out the pups can pretty much take care of themselves. They don't really need me around.

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh.

<b>Jake</b>:  Yeah. I guess rainicorns age really fast. They're basically like older than me already. Kil Whan has a beard now!

<b>Finn</b>:  Oh!

<b>Jake</b>:  Ah, it's okay! I got a slammin' family right here too! [<i>hugs them</i>] Plus all my stuff is here.
