[<i>In <a href="/wiki/Castle_Lemongrab" title="Castle Lemongrab">Castle Lemongrab</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lemongrab_3" title="Lemongrab 3">Lemongrab</a> is seated at a table with some of <a href="/wiki/Lemon_People" title="Lemon People">his subjects</a>. A waiter serves up some <a href="/wiki/Lemonjon" title="Lemonjon">Lemonjons</a>.</i>]

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Commence dinner.

[<i>Everyone at the table eats a spoonful of Lemonjons simultaneously.</i>]

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Dinner is concluded.

<b>Everyone else</b>: [<i>in unison</i>] Concluded. [<i>clap twice</i>]

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Up.

[<i>His subjects carry him to his room bucket brigade-style, passing him one to the other over their heads. They drop him off at his window and leave in a hurry. <a href="/wiki/Lemongrab" title="Lemongrab" class="mw-redirect">Lemongrab</a> watches his subjects harvest bunches of Lemonjons from a tree and drop them into a machine that separates them. The machine spits them out one at a time onto a conveyor belt, where they are then smashed with wooden mallets by more workers. The smashed bits are scooped into bags, then sown into a tilled field. Nearby, a Lemon Person is constructing a statue of Lemongrab out of lemon concrete.</i>]

<b>Lemon Person</b>: Ooh!

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Mm. Lights out!

[<i>All the workers collapse at their posts and immediately fall asleep. Lemongrab is carried into bed by his subjects. They place a baseball mitt on Lemongrab's right hand and a bag of Lemonjons on his nightstand, then turn out the light. Lemongrab gazes up at the ceiling at a mural depicting <a href="/wiki/Matthew" title="Matthew">Matthew</a> and the obstacles leading up to him. The ceiling cracks a little.</i>]

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Huh?!

[<i>A bit of the ceiling falls on Lemongrab's bed, leaving a small hole in the mural. A bug-like Lemon creature crawls out of it, and a low, distant roar sounds. Lemongrab gets stressed and grabs the bag of Lemonjons off his nightstand. He leaves his castle on his <a href="/wiki/Lemon_Camel" title="Lemon Camel">Lemon Camel</a>.</i>]

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Bye.

[<i>The gatekeepers close the gate and collapse back to sleep. On a mountain, <a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a> is lying on his back with a telescope, and <a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a> is preparing something over a campfire.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Better get up here, Jake. It's about to happen.

<b>Jake</b>: Coming! Just gotta get this cocoa pipin'.

<b>Finn</b>: Your loss, man. The <a href="/wiki/Dap_of_the_Heavens" title="Dap of the Heavens">Dap of the Heavens</a> only happens every 20 years. [<i>Finn looks through telescope</i>] Oh, man. It's going down.

[<i>Two constellations tap their "fists" together.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Okay. Let's watch some stars.

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm. You missed it. It was honestly a little disappointing.

<b>Jake</b>: Oh. Okay. Hey, man, I think I hear something weird over there with my little doggy ears.

[<i>Finn looks through his telescope at <a href="/wiki/Flame_Princess" title="Flame Princess">Flame Princess</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cinnamon_Bun" title="Cinnamon Bun">Cinnamon Bun</a> working out. They take a rest.</i>]

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Phew! You are killing, Cinnamon Bun! This routine is locked up!

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Oh! Thank you, Princess. You are also killing.

<b>Finn</b>: You mean Flame Princess?

<b>Jake</b>: Naw, man. What I heard didn't sound like her. Give me a peek on there. This is pretty much just a tube. [<i>Jake looks through his flesh-scope and takes Finn's telescope</i>] Huh. It's Lemongrab.

<b>Finn</b>: Uh, Lemongrab?! What's he up to at this time of night?

<b>Jake</b>: Uh... it looks like he's headed for the <a href="/wiki/Mountain_of_Matthew" title="Mountain of Matthew">Mountain of Matthew</a>. I hear beaucoup spookoo legends about that place.

<b>Finn</b>: Beaucoup spookoo, you say? We should follow him.

<b>Jake</b>: Huh? How come you care where Lemongrab goes?

<b>Finn</b>: He could, you know, he could be messing with crazy mystic power at that mountain. It's like seeing a baby playing with dynamite. Plus, seeing Flame Princess kind of messed me up. Now I gotta distract myself with work.

<b>Jake</b>: Okay, okay. I feel you. Let's do some things. [<i>Jake shapeshifts into a glider and flies Finn to the mountain</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: There's his Lemon Camel. Lemongrease must be inside already.

[<i>Finn and Jake run inside caves below the Mountain of Matthew.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Whoa!

[<i>A Guardian of the Mountain forms and separates Jake from Finn.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Huh? C'mon man!

<b>Guardian of the Mountain</b>: Nope. [<i>Jake and Finn try to reunite from the right. The Guardian of the Mountain forms another hand to block them.</i>]

<b>Guardian of the Mountain</b>: Nuh uh. [<i>Jake attempts to stretch upwards over the Guardian of the Mountain. The guardian extends its right hand upwards to block him.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Dang it! [<i>Jake points at the guardian.</i>] Quit bustin' my buns!

<b>Guardian of the Mountain</b>: [<i>They look down at Jake.</i>] You have no beeswax in the Mountain of Matthew, supple yellow dog. But you, plucky adolescent, you have way cray beeswax.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Jake makes a noise of irritation.</i>] You gonna be okay by yourself?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Finn glances to the staircase leading upwards into the mountain before looking back at Jake.</i>] Yeah, man.

<b>Jake</b>: Okay. [<i>Finn and Jake fistbump. Finn runs towards the staircase and climb it while Jake turns his back to the guardian and sits down.</i>] Just gonna sit down over hereâ€”

<b>Guardian of the Mountain</b>: [<i>Jake attempts to stretch over the Guardian of the Mountain and is blocked again.</i>] Not even.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Jake goes back to normal and sits back down.</i>] Dong it!

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Rocks. Dripping water. More rocks. Oh, I'm becoming stressed!

<b>Matthew</b>: Continue forward.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Hmm?

<b>Matthew</b>: To reach me, you must choose correctly.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Aah!

<b><a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a></b>: Come, Earl of Lemongrab! Let us play the game of catch. I am eager to relate to you.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Yes. I desire this, as well. Huh?

<b><a href="/wiki/Lemonhope" title="Lemonhope">Lemonhope</a></b>: Thank you! Thank you all! As your younger, more relatable new ruler, I shall endeavor to undo all the order imposed by my predecessor! [<i>All cheering</i>]

<b>Lemongrab</b>: I unaccept!

<b>Lemonhope</b>: No, Lemongrab! You are unacceptable!

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Prepare to be served in a pitcher by a little child!

<b><a href="/wiki/Lemongrab_2" title="Lemongrab 2">Lemongrab 2</a></b>: What a wondrous time you've experienced, and tomorrow there will be more adventures to be had for little Lemonsweets.

<b><a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Lemongrab" title="Earl of Lemongrab">Lemongrab 3</a></b>: Ooh, wave farewell! What a lucky little boy you are to live so gaily.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Lemonsweets.

<b>Matthew</b>: Choose.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Ohh!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Lemongrab!  We understand your styles. We are of the same styles. [<i>Laughs</i>]

[<i>Lemonhope playing upbeat melody</i>]

<b>Lemongrab 2</b>: Eee! Aaaaaaaaaaah!

<b>Lemongrab 3</b>: No! It is my love that he prefers! He is spiteful of your love!

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Don't hurt him! Ohhh! [<i>Breathing heavily</i>] What? [<i>Grunts</i>] No! [<i>Both shouting indistinctly</i>] [<i>Grunts</i>] Ohhh! Aaaah! Ohhhh! I'm inside you! Aaaaah!

<b>Lemongrab</b>: [<i>Grunts</i>] Mnh. Sticky. [<i>Groans</i>] Gross! Aww! What is this? Aaaah! Why?! Ohh! Shoosh! [<i>Grunting</i>] Okay. [<i>Groaning</i>] Whoa! Ohh! Whoa! [<i>Grunts</i>] Whoa! Whoa! Oh, whoa! Gross! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [<i>Gasps</i>] Blackness all over! Rolling in grease! You want to humiliate me?! Whoop! [<i>Grunts</i>]

<b>Matthew</b>: Taste the grease, Lemongrab.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Okay. It's lemony.

<b>Matthew</b>: Look up, man.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: [<i>Grunts</i>] Aaaaaah! I am grease?!

<b>Finn</b>: Lemongrab, where you at?! Uh, cool.

<b>Matthew</b>: To reach me, you must choose correctly.

<b>Finn</b>: Who's that Matthew? Whuh-oh!

<b>Flame Princess</b>: Yo, get up, C.B.! This routine's got to be high-level outside the box!

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Hey, Finn, quick! Be me, bro! Be me, bro!

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, yeah! It's time, BMO!

<b>BMO</b>: What is it? I can't smell.

<b>Jake</b>: <a href="/wiki/Finn_Cake" title="Finn Cake">Finn Cakes</a>, boy!

<b>BMO</b>: Yummy! Ooh.

<b>Finn</b>: Yo. Dang. Finn Cakes. That's not fair.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Okay. Goodbye, lemongrease.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Goodbye, where?

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Goodbye from my grease body into the blackness, where only my pure essence can go!

<b>Jake</b>: Up-up, BMO. Finn always gets the first Finn Cake.

<b>BMO</b>: Yo, give me a break.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Pure essence! Eject! [<i>Squish!</i>] Blorg! Bleject!

<b>Finn</b>: Lemongrab! Huh? Whoo!

<b>Finn</b>: Later, spirit bro. [<i>Grunts</i>] Huh? What the heck am I running on? Oh, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Cool. [<i>Chuckles</i>] [<i>Laughs</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Lemongrab, you okay?!

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Finn, don't mess me up.

<b>Matthew</b>: Hi, Finn.

<b>Finn</b>: You're Matthew, huh? [<i>Shing!</i>] Your rep precedes you, bro. "Proceeds"?

<b>Matthew</b>: What kind of rep?

<b>Finn</b>: Some stuff Jake said that I interpreted as negative.

<b>Matthew</b>: Well, ask yourself if that feels right.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>to Finn Sword</i>] What do you say, guy? [<i>Finn Sword shakes his head</i>]

<b>Matthew</b>: The meat bodies who've journeyed to this mountain have distilled themselves to their original source materials and  now exist in oneness.

<b>Finn</b>: Oneness? That's you, bro?

<b>Matthew</b>: I keep adding to myself until the second age of terror, when I will emerge in my final form and restore the world.

<b>Finn</b>: That's why you're here, L.G.? To merge with Matthew?

<b>Lemongrab</b>: It is one option, to know the ecstasy of my ego death.

<b>Finn</b>: Oh. Well, nice knowing you? I mean, I know you got issues. But you're, uh...

<b>Lemongrab</b>: I know.

<b>Finn</b>: Are you sure, though?

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Here's my other option. You see these? Lemonjons?

<b>Matthew</b>: Uh-oh.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: These lemonjons are me, and I wonder if they can destroy you.

<b>Finn</b>: Ooh, boy. Lemongrab, hold up!

<b>Lemongrab</b>: If you are the head that blooms atop the ziggurat, then the stairs that lead to you must be infinite!

<b>Finn</b>: Careful with those metaphors, bro!

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Infinite stairs are unacceptable!

<b>Matthew</b>: [<i>Gulps, gasps</i>] Ohh. Aaaaah!

<b>Finn</b>: Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Geez!

<b>Creature</b>: [<i>All groaning</i>] Oh, no, bro! Heck, no, bro!

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Try it, grease! [<i>Shouting continues</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Yes! Pow! Yeah! I got you, bro!

<b>Jake</b>: Why are you being so opaque about not letting me in there?

<b>Guardian of the Mountain</b>: Well, get out a pen and paper and I'll school you on this biz. [<i>Boom!</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Gol' ding!

<b>Finn</b>: Dude, I was gonna ask him to move.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Oh.

<b>Jake</b>: Yo, class, hold on. Uh...

<b>Lemongrab</b>: [<i>All moaning</i>] I'm done! Let's go!

<b>Jake</b>: Okay. Here we are.

<b>Lemongrab</b>: Bye! Aaaaaah! [<i>Munching</i>]
