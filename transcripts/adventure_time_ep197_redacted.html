<b>Mr. X</b>: [<i>Heavy breathing</i>]

[<i>Cage rattling</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Squirrel_(The_Duke)" title="Squirrel (The Duke)">Squirrel</a></b>: [<i>Grunting</i>] Raaaah! Raaah! Come on! Get ready, toids! Raaah! I'm mean as a bus, and I'm mad as rocks!

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Gumball guardians! There's an enemy at the gates!

<b>Squirrel</b>: I'm an all-you-can-eat maniac! Whoops! Aw, come on! Ooh, ooh, ooh!

<b>Candy Person</b>: Whoopee!

[<i>Crowd cheering</i>]

[<i>Crowd murmuring</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/King_of_Ooo" title="King of Ooo">King of Ooo</a></b>: Thank you, little candies. Thank you. You warm the wax heart of this poor king of Ooo! Now, I hear you asking, "King of Ooo, how can you be so wise?" I'll tell you how. Did you know that I am 8000 years old? Could be.

[<i>Crowd cheering</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: It's true. I'm that wonderful.

[<i>Lens clicks</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Now, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a> — she <i>says</i> she hasn't gone rogue. She <i>says</i> she's not a wild dog thirsty for blood. She <i>says she's not a literal baby</i> masquerading as an adult woman. She says a lot of things. Princess Bubblegum, you don't make sense!

[<i>Crowd cheering</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></b>: This guy's really working on me.

<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>: Ennnh...

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Yes, dear? Do you have something to say?

<b><a href="/wiki/James%27_Mom" title="James' Mom" class="mw-redirect">Mrs. James</a></b>: Mm-hmm. I'm James' mother, Mrs. James. My son got turned into a mutant mass and was exiled to the badlands by Princess Bubblegum.

[<i>Crowd boos</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Trehh! Boo.

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Who <i>isn't</i> mad about their mutant children?

<b>Candy dude</b>: What about <a href="/wiki/The_Lich_(character)" title="The Lich (character)">Sweet P</a>, King of Ooo? You threatened to burn down <a href="/wiki/Tree_Trunks_(character)" title="Tree Trunks (character)">his mama</a>'s orchard.

<b>King of Ooo</b>: I did. That is true. Sweet P, I was like a cornered animal. "I knew no' what thy doone." I'm sorry, Sweet P. Here. Psst — give me a kiss.

[<i>Smooches</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Do you hear us, Princess Bubblegum? Do you hear us?!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Shhhhhhhhut up.

[<i>Door opens</i>]

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Princess, I'm sorry to disturb you, but I feel that you must campaign. The candy people are real dumb.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I'm studying something that could be real important. Dah! This dumb election. It's not even — [<i>yawning</i>] I mean, it's barely even — [<i>yawns</i>] ...barely even legal.

<b>King of Ooo</b>: A barely and yet fully legal election — that's what my campaign manager told me. Let's hear it for him — Mr. X! [<i>Laughs</i>] Weird, right?

[<i>Crowd cheering</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: And even being legal, I mean, I <i>made</i> everyone. I made their homes. The candy people are mercurial, but they're not dillweeds.

<b>King of Ooo</b>: And this definitely legal election is in the jam-covered fingers of you, the people — the candies. [<i>Grunts</i>] So, go. Vote with your hearts. Vote with your minds. Vote for the candidate who's <i>not</i> a teenage gum-golem.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I mean, they know that I love them.

<b><a href="/wiki/Starchy" title="Starchy">Starchy</a></b>: And the votes are in. King of Ooo is our new princess.

[<i>All cheering</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Hey, hey!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: What?!

[<i>Rapid footsteps</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Whaaaaat?! You dillweeds! You're a dillweed, you're a dillweed's secretary, and you're probably some dillweed I've never met! You're three dillweeds being dillweeds, and you're going to dillweed this place into the ground! And <i>you —</i> [<i>growls</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Princess! Princess! I don't know what a dillweed is.

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, PB, what's the plan? We pledged our allegiance to <i>you.</i>

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Your allegiance is to the kingdom. [<i>Sighs</i>] Dudes, I don't know. I don't know when I'll be back in charge — <i>if</i> I'll be back in charge. I need you both to stick around here and make sure the candy people are safe, even if it means working for a wad. Auf wiedersehen, meine champions. Mwah. Mwah.

[<i>Bells ringing</i>]

[<i>Crowd cheering</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: There's a new golden and waxy mornin'. Good times a-comin'. You've got your warning. There's cheap healthcare, the workcamp's there. The general tone is laissez-faire. I'm a princess, I'm a princess. I'm a priiiinceeeess.

[<i>Peppermint Butler grunting</i>]

[<i>Lock rattling</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: What's up, Peps?

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: It's stuck.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>Grunts</i>] [<i>Strains</i>]

[<i>Clatter</i>]

[<i>Wood clattering</i>]

[<i>Bats screeching</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Ho, no, no, no, no! It's okay, everyone. It's okay. Close your eyes and repeat your safety mantra — hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie —

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Princess?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Huh? Oh. Sorry, peps. I'm just so used to having my citizens around to protect. This is gonna take some getting used to.

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: Permission to speak freely, ma'am?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Granted.

<b>Peppermint Butler</b>: This horrible dump does not meet the level of fancy to which I have become accustomed.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Noted. Also, FYI — my Uncle Gumbald built this cabin with his bare hands. I spent my summers here when I was younger. Anyway, it'll probably take a <i>really</i> long time for the candy people to realize a bad ruler is worse than a good ruler. Plenty of time to spruce this place up.

<b>Starchy</b>: Whew! Starchy thought life would be better under the King of Ooo, but now there's even more stuff to sweep. [<i>Sighs</i>] Poor old Starchy. Always getting the sweaty end of the lollipop.

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, Starchy. What are you doing — sweeping?

<b>Starchy</b>: Oh, uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Suh-wee-ee-eepin'. Yeah.

<b>Jake</b>: Mm. Hey, is it me, or is getting purpler out here?

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, yeah. I think that's the catalyst comet. Guess it's getting pretty close or whatever.

<b>Jake</b>: Getting close? Should we evacuate or...

<b>Finn</b>: What? No, no. It's cool, I think. It's just here to, like, shake things up, you know?It's okay. We've got sort of a — a relationship.

<b>Starchy</b>: C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-comet?! Oh, Starchy don't feel good about this.

<b>Jake</b>: Starch?

<b>Finn</b>: Eht.

Starchy's mind is burdened. Oh, Mrs. gumdrop! He's coming. The comet — it's gonna snuff out all life as we know it.

<b>Mrs. gumdrop</b>: What?! Oh, good Glob!

<b>Jake</b>: Shouldn't we try and calm them down?

<b>Finn</b>: Ehh, not after that whole knock-my-tower-over-onto-the-castle thing. A lot of guys got smooshed. They need to hear it from someone they really trust.

<b>Finn</b>: King of Ooo!

<b>Jake</b>: King of Ooo!

<b>Finn</b>: King of Ooo?

<b>Jake</b>: King of Ooo?

<b>Finn</b>: King of Ooo?

<b>Jake</b>: Wait, are you saying "King of Ooo"?

<b>Finn</b>: What are you saying?

<b>Jake</b>: I thought it was "kinkoff goo."

[<i>Tapping</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Hey. You hear that?

[<i>Tapping continues</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Downstairs. King of Ooo? King of Ooo?

<b>Jake</b>: King of Ooo!

[<i>Tapping continues</i>]

[<i>Ratcheting</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: What the —

<b>Finn</b>: It's that guy from before. He's mucking around with PB's ship — added all kinds of engines to it.

<b>Jake</b>: Hey!

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, what do you think you're doing? PB don't let <i>nobody</i> touch her stuff — not even me, and I'm cool — least of all you, you sauce-tasting Brian-sniffer — whoa!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Gasps</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Yeeh! Yeeh! Whoa! Uhhh! [<i>Weakly</i>] No mercy, Jake.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>Straining</i>] [<i>Chuckles</i>] Aaaaah!

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, I'm back — [<i>Gasps</i>] What the bing bong ping pong?! Gunther?!

[<i>Chirps</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: What the king Kong sing song?! Whoaaaa — oof!

<b>Gunter</b>: Sayonara, suckers! [<i>Laughs evilly</i>]

[<i>Crowd screaming</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Uhh...

<b>Banana Guard</b>: [<i>Grunts</i>]

<b>Banana Guard</b>: [<i>Grunts</i>]

<b>Candy person</b>: Ugh!

<b>Starchy</b>: Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Oww!

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Aaaaah!

<b>Toronto</b>: [<i>Munching</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Toronto, I've been princess for four hours, and society has already totally collapsed. Plus, now the sky is falling, I guess. Is this possibly... Somehow my fault?

<b>Toronto</b>: Pbbt! No way! Okay, look. Without your calming presence and selfless leadership, this situation would have been a hundred times worse. History will remember you as Ooo's greatest hero.

<b>King of Ooo</b>: As always, the voice of reason. Once again, my saintly nature has compelled me, unthinking, to assume the burdens of others. But a true justice demands a true accounting. And truly this is all Bubblegum's fa-aa-aa-ault!

[<i>Rumbling</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Oof! Good glob! What no-o-o-o-o-w?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Looking good, Peps. Man, this feels kind of good, right? It's like we're building a whole new kingdom from scratch, only without all my beloved citizens this time... and their dull, pleading chicken eyes. Maybe the King of Ooo <i>could</i> hold down the fort for a little while. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? Anyway, I'm gonna get some fresh air. B.R.B. What the — why's it so purple outsi—
