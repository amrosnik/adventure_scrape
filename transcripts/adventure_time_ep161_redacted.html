<b>Finn</b>: But I've been pounding pickle juice like I was preggos. For the electrolytes.

<b>Doctor Princess</b>: Well, switch back to water. But what I really want to know, is how are you feeling Finn?

<b>Finn</b>: What? Oh, I don't know. [<i>imitates trumpet tooting</i>], I guess I don't feel anything. Bleh. [<i>slides off the bed</i>]

<b>Doctor Princess</b>: Okay, that's what I thought. You gotta bounce back, man. You got burned by your bad dad, you lost your arm, and all the ladies say you don't talk to <a href="/wiki/Flame_Princess" title="Flame Princess">Flame Princess</a> no more.

<b>Finn</b>: Who's sayin' that?

<b>Doctor Princess</b>: Finn, flowers thrive on good vibes. As your doctor, I'm ordering you to go out and have fun, okay?

<b>Finn</b>: You want to go with me to <a href="/wiki/Crab_Princess" title="Crab Princess">Crab Princess</a>' party tonight?

<b>Doctor Princess</b>: Uh, what? Like... as a date?

<b>Finn</b>: Sure. That would be fun, right?

<b>Doctor Princess</b>: Finn, I don't date my patients.

<b>Finn</b>: It's cool. Guess I'll go make out with Crab Princess.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>Shaking off Breezy from his arm</i>] Yo, come on bee! Geez!

<b>Breezy</b>: Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize—

<b>Finn</b>: Didn't realize what? That there's a person attached to this flower?

<b>Breezy</b>: Uh, yes. I'm sorry. But it's only because your flower's the greatest miracle of all time. It's just doing something to me, I—[<i>tears up</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, that's cool. Thanks, beezy.

<b>Breezy</b>: My name's Breezy.

<b>Raggedy Princess</b>: [<i>muffled</i>] Never mind, Finn. [<i>The cup is on her mouth. She laughs and spits the cup away, then runs away laughing.</i>]

<b>Breezy</b>: So uh, what are you doing here? Heh.

<b>Finn</b>: Ah, well, I came here to make out with Crab Princess, but I sort of lost steam on the walk over. [<i>Breezy stares intensely at Finn's flower</i>] I don't know what crabs are into. I'm just gonna stop trying and let my flower wilt away. Who cares?

<b>Breezy</b>: I'll try for you, man.

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa! Really?

<b>Breezy</b>: Yeah! I'm gonna help you, friend.

[<i>Breezy buzzes towards Crab and <a href="/wiki/Emerald_Princess" title="Emerald Princess">Emerald Princess</a> and sits on Emerald Princess' gem, eavesdropping on their conversation.</i>]

<b>Breezy</b>: Hey, you did it!

<b>Finn</b>: Oh, you're still here.

<b>Breezy</b>: Yeah, [<i>chuckles</i>] just checking in... on my buddy. So, how you feelin', buddy?

<b>Finn</b>: Pretty grease. I made out with Crab Princess, so that's grease. But really I don't feel nothing. Maybe if I made out, I will feel something? Maybe I'll reach a "good vibe" saturation point. And then my flower will feel good, too...

[<i>Breezy is now on Finn's flower.</i>]

<b>Breezy</b>: Your flower feels good, yes.

[<i>Finn shakes Breezy off his flower.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] Hey, cut it out, Breezy.

<b>Breezy</b>: Ha ha! I'm just messin' around. We're buddies, right?

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, Breezy, I like you. You're a good wingman.

<b>Frozen Yogurt Princess</b>: Frozen Yogurt Princess.

<b>Jake</b>: Whoa. You're a dead ringer for Flame Princess, with a smidge of Princess Bubblegum mixed in. [<i>To Finn</i>] Guess you're still hung up on both of 'em, bro.

<b>Finn</b>: Exactly. [<i>Finn sits, leaning on a log.</i>] I'm just trying to have fun. You know, doctor's orders. But I still ain't feelin' nothing. [<i>sighs</i>] maybe I should just let this poor flower die.

<b>Breezy</b>: Noooo... Listen, buddy, being a free spirit is fun and all, but you got a responsibility to that flower, just like I got a responsibility. Get this—I'm actually a virgin queen bee. I was born to lead a hive, destined for a life of obligation and ritual.

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa. Bummer.

<b>Breezy</b>: Yes. Once I drink of the royal jelly, my carefree days are done.

<b>Finn</b>: Dang. That sounds like raw deez. Breezy, you got to stay free... Free to make out with whatevs. [<i>Finn jumps up</i>]

<b>Breezy</b>: Yeah, maybe you're right. You know, it's too bad we're such great buddies or we could make out with each other. [<i>chuckles</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Um... You know, I'm—I'm trying to keep it casual, B. I just don't feel the same way. I don't feel anything.

<b>Breezy</b>: [<i>Now sad</i>] But I royal jellied for you. [<i>sniffles</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: Wha? Where you going?

<b>Finn</b>: That's it. We made out.

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: Wha—What?! I didn't wait infinity for a dip in the kiddie pool! We're taking this to the deep end!
