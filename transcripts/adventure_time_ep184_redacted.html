<b>Jake</b>: Yeah. Don't you know about Super Porp Day?

<b>Marceline</b>: Wait. "Super Porp"... like in the old commercials? Uh, let's see, like, ♪Super Porp, it hits the spot, messes up your train of thought. If you're thirsty and out of shape...♪

<b>BMO</b>: I love you, Cheryl.

[<i>Finn hands Marceline a can.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Man, this biz takes me back. I used to drink this stuff all the time when I was a kid.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>mutters gibberish</i>] Okay, listen. So, okay, we could go track down the mysterious source of Super Porp. Do up a fuh-real, end up fightin' some big soda-computer-god-baby or whatever... We totally could. But... Super Porp is good. So why question this good thing, man? Why?

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm. Yeah, okay. Let's just go home.

<b>Susan</b>: Uh.

[<i>One of the workers reaches into the vat they are stirring. Another worker stops her and slaps her face.</i>]

<b>Female Worker</b>: Hey! No one is allowed to taste pure Porp syrup! You know this, Carla.

<b>Carla</b>: But it looks sooo good!

<b>Female Worker</b>: Well, of course it does! I mean, I'd smash everyone's face in this room for a single drop of pure Porp, but that's not the Super Porp way.

<b>Carla</b>: [<i>whines</i>]

<b>Female Worker</b>: Aw, cheer up, girl. Maybe we'll get bonus reg Porp after that new baby gets processed.

[<i>Susan breaks a pipe and swings down to the floor on it.</i>]

<b>Susan</b>: Baby!

<b>Workers</b>: [<i>gasp</i>]

[<i>Sally jumps down from above, hitting the dog in the face and knocking it on its back. Susan rips her hat off as she gasps for air, suffocated by the Porp.

<b>Cheryl</b>: Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh. [<i>turns chair around</i>] Hey. How's it going?

<b>Celina</b>: Cheryl?

<b>Susan</b>: Susan hates Cheryl!

<b>Cheryl</b>: So... you're the dinguses who trashed my facility.

<b>Susan</b>: Yes. Susan is the dingus. Now gimme the baby!

<b>Cheryl</b>: Oh, I see. You don't understand what's going on. This is a super spesh baby, a destiny baby, selected by my loyal delivery drones to take my place as high mascot Cheryl. [<i>opens can of Super Porp and prepares to feed it to the baby</i>] For you see—

[<i>Susan uppercuts Cheryl and catches the baby.</i>]

<b>Susan</b>: Don't drink that.

<b>Cheryl</b>: [<i>groans</i>] [<i>mask falls off</i>] Good job, bozo. Without a new Cheryl, brand awareness will go straight down the toilet. Our in-your-face flavor will be lost forever. Who are you to condemn our weird ancient ways? [<i>melts into a puddle</i>]

[<i>The workers cheer as the three exit the control room, Susan wearing Cheryl's mask.</i>]

<b>Susan</b>: Stop!

<b>Susan</b>: Yes, I <i>am</i> Cheryl. [<i>kicks apart a pipe</i>]

<b>Workers</b>: Huh?

<b>Susan</b>: And Cheryl says this is what we do now. Back to work! Everybody, destroy the factory!

[<i>The workers break everything in the factory.</i>]

<b>Workers</b>: Destroy the factory. Back to work. Destroy the factory. Back to work.
