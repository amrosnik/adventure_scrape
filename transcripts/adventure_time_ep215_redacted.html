<b>BMO</b>: Sorry.

<b>BMO</b>: Fine aged cheddar man.

<b>BMO</b>: Homemade ketchup.

<b>BMO</b>: A fresh pepper fart

<b>BMO</b>: Dance, parsley.

<b>BMO</b>: Face bread.

<b>BMO</b>: Special sentient sandwich.

<b><a href="/wiki/Jake" title="Jake">Jake</a></b>: Mmm... Is that special sentient sammich?

<b>BMO</b>: Bingo.

<b>BMO</b>: Made by the BMO.

<b>Jake</b>: BMO, you're my little cherub.

<b>Jake</b>: You know that?

<b>Jake</b>: You made all this for me, right?

<b>Jake</b>: Aaahhh.

<b>BMO</b>: Not so fast, Jake!

<b>Jake</b>: Naaaw.

<b>BMO</b>: The sammiches are yours...

<b>BMO</b>: For a price.

<b>Jake</b>: What?

<b>BMO</b>: I need you to be my tiny horse for the day, so I can do my live-action cowboy role-play adventure.

<b>Jake</b>: No way.

<b>Jake</b>: Poo deal.

<b>Jake</b>: I'll do 20 minutes.

<b>BMO</b>: It took me over six hours to prepare this nosh, Jake!

<b>BMO</b>: Not to mention the time it took acquiring the ingredients through the "special market," putting my safety and my reputation on the line.

<b>Jake</b>: Okay, fine, fine.

<b>Jake</b>: Three sammiches for every hour I'm a horse.

<b>BMO</b>: Mm...

<b>BMO</b>: One sammich per horse-hour, six-hour minimum.

<b>Jake</b>: Deal.

<b>BMO</b>: Yippee-ki-yay!

<b>Jake</b>: Om!

<b>Jake</b>: Mm.

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, yeah.

<b>Jake</b>: It tastes alive.

<b>BMO</b>: Steed yourself, partner.

<b>Jake</b>: Okay.

<b>Jake</b>: Om.

<b>Jake</b>: 'Kay.

<b>BMO</b>: Oh, come on, man.

<b>BMO</b>: You didn't even try.

<b>Jake</b>: I did try.

<b>Jake</b>: Horses are hard.

<b>Jake</b>: How's that?

<b>BMO</b>: Eh, it reads.

<b>BMO</b>: Steady, girl.

<b>Jake</b>: Wha...

<b>BMO</b>: Shh, shh, shh.

<b>BMO</b>: I'm going to mount you now.

<b>BMO</b>: Hup!

<b>BMO</b>: Good girl.

<b>Jake</b>: So, what's the plan anyway, BMO?

<b>BMO</b>: The plan is to punch the toads to the stump and bring justice to the peeps!

<b>Jake</b>: Ow.

<b>BMO</b>: Oh, and by the way, Jake, from now on, you can call me... Angel Face.

<b>BMO</b>: Hyah!

<b>Jake</b>: Yow!

<b>BMO</b>: I used to be a guy who ran from Glob with the wind at my back and the devil on my shoulder.

<b>BMO</b>: Now I'm the guy chasing those guys, yet the devil is still here, sleeping in my couch.

<b>Jake</b>: BMO, that hurt when you dug your boots into my side belly.

<b>Jake</b>: Are you gonna apologize or...

<b>BMO</b>: Horses do not talk.

<b>BMO</b>: Over there! Hyah!

<b>BMO</b>: Whoa!

<b>BMO</b>: Jackrabbit Johnson.

<b>BMO</b>: This guy's wanted for stealing piglets from their mothers while they are feeding.

<b>BMO</b>: Makes me sick.

<b>BMO</b>: He was last seen in dead goat gulch.

<b>BMO</b>: What do you say, girl?

<b>BMO</b>: Want to catch this donkey and split the reward?

<b>Jake</b>: You have 45 minutes left before my next sammich.

<b>BMO</b>: Time's a-wasting!

<b>Jake</b>: Hyee!

<b>BMO</b>: Hmm.

<b>Jake</b>: BMO, I'm tired.

<b>BMO</b>: Looks like my horse needs a rest.

<b>BMO</b>: Slow down, horse.

<b>BMO</b>: ♪ Being a robot cowboy ♪

<b>BMO</b>: ♪ Is a lonely job ♪

<b>BMO</b>: ♪ But somebody has to protect the piglets ♪

<b>BMO</b>: ♪ I got nobody but my horse ♪

<b>BMO</b>: ♪ And my friend the cactus guy ♪

<b>BMO</b>: ♪ It's okay because I like them a lot ♪

<b>BMO</b>: ♪ That's okay, I like being a robot ♪

<b>BMO</b>: ♪ Cowboy ♪

<b>BMO</b>: Be careful, Jake.

<b>BMO</b>: This is where Jackrabbit Johnson's gang of lowlife bandits lays low.

<b>BMO</b>: Hyah!

<b>BMO</b>: Bang! Bang!

<b>BMO</b>: Put them up, partner!

<b>BMO</b>: Hyah!

<b>BMO</b>: Pyew, pyew!

<b>BMO</b>: Pyew, pyew, pyew!

<b>BMO</b>: I want answers!

<b>BMO</b>: [<i>high voice</i>] You can't do this to us!

<b>BMO</b>: No answers, eh?

<b>BMO</b>: No use to me!

<b>BMO</b>: How about you, frisco?

<b>BMO</b>: [<i>high voice</i>] I'm not going to talk.

<b>BMO</b>: Why am I talking to you then?!

<b>BMO</b>: Hooah!

<b>BMO</b>: Yah! Unh!

<b><a href="/wiki/Neptr" title="Neptr">Neptr</a></b>: BMO, what did you do?

<b>BMO</b>: It's Jackrabbit Johnson's right-hand man, Tumbleweed Terk.

<b>Neptr</b>: I spent the last three months building all of this.

<b>Jake</b>: Oh, that's where you been?

<b>Neptr</b>: Mm-hmm.

<b>Neptr</b>: BMO gave me a <a href="/wiki/Finn_Cake" title="Finn Cake">Finn Cake</a>.

<b>BMO</b>: Don't talk to my horse, Tumbleweed.

<b>Neptr</b>: Aah.

<b>BMO</b>: Where is Jackrabbit Johnson?!

<b>BMO</b>: I know you know where he's headed.

<b>Neptr</b>: I <i>don't</i> know!

<b>Neptr</b>: Tumbleweed terk's always the last to know.

<b>Neptr</b>: It's just like I told the other bounty hunter, I swear.

<b>BMO</b>: I don't believe a word you say.

<b>BMO</b>: Now take a message to your compadre.

<b>BMO</b>: Tell him his pal, Angel Face, is itching to get together.

<b>BMO</b>: Tell Jackrabbit Johnson to meet me at Dirtwater Flats, just like the old days!

<b>Neptr</b>: Okay.

<b>BMO</b>: Sock citizens of dead goat gulch, we can rebuild!

<b>Jake</b>: Neigh!

<b><a href="/wiki/Me-Mow" title="Me-Mow">Me-Mow</a></b>: Grrr.

<b>BMO</b>: Uhh...

<b>BMO</b>: I don't remember where Dirtwater Flat is.

<b>BMO</b>: Better stop for the night.

<b>BMO</b>: We can make a campfire here.

<b>BMO</b>: And we will talk about what we will do with the reward money.

<b>Jake</b>: No.

<b>Jake</b>: It's been fun, BMO, but it's time to go home because there are no more sandwiches.

<b>BMO</b>: But I want to finish the adventure.

<b>Jake</b>: Which direction is the house?

<b>BMO</b>: I'm not sure.

<b>BMO</b>: Get down!

<b>Me-Mow</b>: Getting kicked out of the guild of assassins... check.

<b>Me-Mow</b>: Capturing my first bounty...

<b>Me-Mow</b>: Check.

<b>Me-Mow</b>: Going to Finn and Jake's treehouse and getting revenge...

<b>Me-Mow</b>: Unchecked.

<b>Finn</b>: Finn and Jake's treehouse?

<b>Me-Mow</b>: Mm-hmm.

<b>Finn</b>: Who are you, and why do you want to get revenge?

<b>Me-Mow</b>: I... Am... Me-Mow!

<b>Finn</b>: Me-Mow?! Whoa.

<b>Finn</b>: You've gotten bigger.

<b>Me-Mow</b>: Have we met before?

<b>Jake</b>: Finn, is that you?

<b>BMO</b>: That's Jackrabbit Johnson!

<b>Me-Mow</b>: Finn?

<b>Me-Mow</b>: It is Finn!

<b>Me-Mow</b>: Tricked again!

<b>Jake</b>: Look... It's me-mow, BMO.

<b>BMO</b>: I don't care.

<b>BMO</b>: That's my bounty!

<b>BMO</b>: Yaah!

<b>BMO</b>: Jake, transform...

<b>BMO</b>: Horse!

<b>Jake</b>: Whoa, did you have a real gun all this time?

<b>BMO</b>: I am old enough to vote.

<b>Me-Mow</b>: [<i>thinking</i>] <i>Hey, Jake, if you can hear my internal monologue, I'm going to kill you!</i>

<b>BMO</b>: Your Daisy days are over!

<b>BMO</b>: I am the whaler 'round these parts!

<b>BMO</b>: Huh.

<b>Me-Mow</b>: Sounds like you're out of ammo.
