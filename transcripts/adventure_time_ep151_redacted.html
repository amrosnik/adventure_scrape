<b>Marceline</b>: What?

<b>Finn</b>: Why are you holding your bass up high like that?

<b>Marceline</b>: Mm-mm-mmm. (I don't know.) I get better finger action this way.

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>annoyed</i>] Yes?

<b>Simon</b>: Marcy, it's me, Simon. I'm back, but my body might donk out soon, so get to the Ice Kingdom fast and help me with this time portal so I can find Betty and say I'm sorry before I croakboat! I know that's a lot to process, but hurry, and bring Hambo. Hambo is the key.

[<i>Marceline is now on the floor.</i>]

<b>Simon (over telephone)</b>: Okay, Marcy? You got that? Marcy?

[<i>Flashback begins, showing Simon and Marcy walking through post-apocalyptic Ooo.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: A long, long time ago, Simon was my only friend. He was there when I needed help.

[<i>Flashback ends.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>holding Hambo</i>] All he ever wanted was to find Betty, and now I can help him.

[<i>Scene changes to Finn and Marceline riding Jake towards the Ice King's castle. Marceline gets off and enters.</i>]

[<i>They embrace.</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: I thought I'd never see you again.

<b>Simon</b>: I can hardly believe it myself. You're all grown up.

<b>Jake</b>: Believe! She's like a million years old!

<b>Simon</b>: One million years? How could it be?!

<b>Marceline</b>: He's just kidding. I'm only a thousand.

<b>Jake</b>: And still looking good!

<b>Finn</b>: Do you remember anything from when you were the Ice King?

<b>Simon</b>: Nothing specific—just dreamlike impressions.

<b>Finn</b>: Do you still have impressions from all the times we flipped your bricks?

<b>Simon</b>: I have... bruises. [<i>coughs</i>] Excuse me. I—[<i>coughs harder</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: Man, Simon.

<b>Simon</b>: I'm fine. [<i>coughs</i>]

<b>Marceline</b>: You're dying!

<b>Simon</b>: Well, yes, but only in increments. I've still got work to do. Finn and Jake, will you run my generator?

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, man.

[<i>Finn and Jake climb onto the stationary bike and start pedaling.</i>]

<b>Jake</b>: Cool.

[<i>The time travel device starts glowing.</i>]

<b>Simon</b>: That's great! Keep pedaling! All we need now is the catalyst—an object from the past that has been lovingly tended to through the ages.

<b>Marceline</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] Goodbye, Hambo. [<i>kisses it and hugs it one last time</i>]

<b>Simon</b>: Because of you, I can say goodbye to Betty and tell her I'm sorry for driving her away. Thank you, Marceline. [<i>drops Hambo into the liquid</i>]

[<i>The portal opens, showing Betty running around a corner and hiding.</i>]

<b>Betty</b>: [<i>panting</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: [<i>shooting ice lightning skyward</i>] Where's my Betty? Where's my princess?! Princess! Princess!!

<b>Betty</b>: Simon, don't leave me like this.

[<i>Suddenly, the portal opens above her.</i>]

<b>Simon</b>: Betty? Betty. Betty!

<b>Betty</b>: Simon? What is going on?

<b>Simon</b>: I'm a thousand years in the future, love. I opened this portal so we could say goodbye.

<b>Betty</b>: You're dumping me?

<b>Simon</b>: No! It's just that everything changed after I put on that crown. I—I went crazy. You ran away. I—I never saw you again.

<b>Betty</b>: But where would I go without you?

<b>Simon</b>: I'll never know.

<b>Betty</b>: I don't understand. You don't seem crazy now. I mean, in the future.

[<i>The portal opening starts shrinking.</i>]

<b>Simon</b>: The portal is closing. There's no time to explain. Just know that I love you, and I forgive you for leaving me.

<b>Betty</b>: Simon, I know who I'm leaving you for!

<b>Simon</b>: Who?

<b>Betty</b>: [<i>leaps through portal</i>] You, dum-dum! [<i>kisses Simon</i>]

[<i>Simon collapses.</i>]

<b>Betty</b>: Simon? [<i>picks him up and places him on the magic carpet</i>] What's wrong? Are you sick?

<b>Simon</b>: No, I'm old. The crown was keeping me alive, but its magic was negated by the creature Bella Noche.

<b>Betty</b>: Don't die, Simon. I just got here.

<b>Simon</b>: Oh, I'm sorry, Betty.

<b>Betty</b>: I know! I'll fix the crown, and then I'll figure out how to fix you!

<b>Simon</b>: What? No. Guys, stop her.

<b>Jake</b>: Uh...

<b>Marceline</b>: Hmm...

<b>Finn</b>: Yeah, but...

<b>Jake</b>: It kind of sounds like a good idea.

<b>Betty</b>: Right, whoever you are. [<i>takes crown from Gunter and walks back to Simon</i>] I'm sorry. It's the only way. [<i>pulls carpet out from under him</i>]

<b>Simon</b>: No!

<b>Betty</b>: [<i>gets on carpet</i>] Okay, rug, take me to Bella Noche.

[<i>Simon grabs on to the back and flies upward out of the castle with Betty.</i>]

<b>Betty</b>: Get on, Simon!

<b>Simon</b>: I am getting on... the death bus.

<b>Death</b>: [<i>flying alongside them</i>] I've got you in my sights, Simon. [<i>laughs</i>]

<b>Simon</b>: It's my time, Betty! I don't want to be the Ice King again. It's like living with eternal diaper butt. I can't do it!

<b>Betty</b>: Not forever. Destroying Bella Noche and getting your power back will buy me time to find a loophole that'll undo your curse and your death. I can do it! You got to believe me, Simon.

<b>Simon</b>: I...

<b>Death</b>: Get real, man. You're gonna be the Ice King till the sun blows up. This is your one chance. I made a mix tape for the ride: "Summer Jams 3"!

<b>Simon</b>: If I don't let her try, then what am I? What am us?

<b>Betty</b>: What?

<b>Death</b>: Eh, fair enough. See you in a few. [<i>disappears</i>]

<b>Ron James</b>: Heck yeah! Ron James always delivers! Check it out, brotha! Yaah! [<i>throws potion at Bella Noche</i>] In your face!

<b>Bella Noche</b>: [<i>screams</i>]

<b>Grand Master Wizard &amp; Ron James</b>: Yeah!

[<i>Bella Noche grows even larger.</i>]

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>: What the stink is that?!

<b>Ron James</b>: My lab conditions were not ideal.

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>: But you did not deliver! [<i>shakes him</i>]

<b>Ron James</b>: Peace, man! Aaah!

[<i>Betty and Simon arrive.</i>]

<b>Betty</b>: We're here to help!

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>: Help how?

[<i>Bella Noche shoots an electric bolt at Ron James and Grand Master Wizard, who both fall flat on their backs.</i>]

<b>Grand Master Wizard</b>: We're toast, bro.

<b>Betty</b>: Simon!

<b>Simon</b>: [<i>sighs</i>]

<b>Betty</b>: Hey, don't scare me like that.

<b>Simon</b>: Just hold my hand to your face. This will be my... last sensation.

<b>Betty</b>: Don't be a wimp, Simon! Just give me a second! [<i>gets on carpet and flies toward Bella Noche</i>]

<b>Death</b>: You got about 15 seconds.

[<i>Bella Noche shoots at Betty, propelling her onto the creature's exterior. Betty then climbs inside and reaches the core.</i>]

<b>Bella Noche</b>: How the—? Wait.

<b>Betty</b>: Surprise! [<i>punches, then kicks Bella Noche</i>] Tranch.

[<i>Bella Noche explodes, sending out a shock wave of magic energy.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Hey, don't be jealous, Muscle Princess. She's gone—kablooey. Let's be realistic, right? We both know you're not my top pick.

[<i>Muscle Princess breaks free.</i>]

<b>Ice King</b>: Oh, <a href="/wiki/Grob_Gob_Glob_Grod" title="Grob Gob Glob Grod">Grod</a>!
