<b>Jake</b>: Man, birthday-holiday overlap. That's some tough luck. Everyone's all jollied-out when it's your turn for jollies.

<b><a href="/wiki/Finn" title="Finn">Finn</a></b>: Well... you know, it's not actually the holidays. Plus, <a href="/wiki/BMO" title="BMO">BMO</a> wasn't actually even born.

<b>Jake</b>: Well, I suppose. But you don't got to be so technical about it.

<b>Finn</b>: Listen, all I'm saying is we—

[<i>Phone rings. Finn answers it.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hello?

<b><a href="/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum" title="Princess Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a></b>: Hey, it's me. Is there a big rainbow over your house right now spelling out "Happy birthday, BMO"?

<b>Finn</b>: No. Actually, it's snowing like crazy.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Okay, that's what I was afraid of.

[<i><a href="/wiki/Peppermint_Butler" title="Peppermint Butler">Peppermint Butler</a> sprays fire extinguisher.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Peppermint Butler spilled grape juice on my experimental weather machine, and now it's going kablooey.

[<i>Part of the machine explodes.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I got to stay here to fix this thing. Tell BMO I'm sorry I missed the party.

<b>Finn</b>: That's okay. BMO doesn't care any—

[<i>Princess Bubblegum hangs up.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: BMO only cares about one special guest.

<b><a href="/wiki/Neptr" title="Neptr">Neptr</a></b>: [<i>gasps</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: <a href="/wiki/Moe" title="Moe">Moe</a>! Hooray! Moe is coming! And he brought me a special surprise for my birthday! Moe is the smartest man in the world.

[<i>Brief flashback of Moe carried by <a href="/wiki/MOs" title="MOs">MMO</a></i>]

<b>BMO</b>: He's way smarter than you and you and you, too, Jake—and you're the smartest guy I know.

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, thanks.

<b>BMO</b>: And he knows everything about robots. He built me, and he built himself, and all the other MOs. He's so smart! I bet he could even fix Neptr.

<b>Neptr</b>: What? What's wrong with me?

[<i>Knocking at the door</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: Oh, boy, oh, boy! He's here! [<i>jumps downstairs</i>] Hooray! Hooray! [<i>opens door</i>] Oh. You are not Moe.

[<i>An unknown MO steps inside, wearing a white wig and sounding like Moe.</i>]

<b>MO</b>: Why, of course I am, BMO. [<i>chuckles</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: Oh, okay!

<b>Jake</b>: Hey, Moe! New haircut?

<b>Finn</b>: Whoa, Moe! What happened to your body?

<b>MO</b>: Oh, oh! [<i>chuckles</i>] Oh, that old thing? She conked out on me months ago. I guess I don't make 'em like I used to. [<i>chuckles</i>] Not like little BMO here. You got all my love and affection.

<b>BMO</b>: Thanks!

<b>Jake</b>: Well, we made a cake.

<b>Finn</b>: We weren't sure if you eat, but BMO insisted.

<b>BMO</b>: Eating helps me grow!

<b>MO</b>: Oh! [<i>chuckles</i>] Well, er, uh... when in Rome.

[<i>Cut to outside the Tree Fort, where it is still snowing, then inside, at the table, where Finn and Jake set up plates, and BMO, Neptr, and "Moe" are sitting.</i>]

<b>MO</b>: So, BMO, are you ready for your birthday surprise?

<b>BMO</b>: Boy, howdy!

<b>MO</b>: For your birthday, I got you...a special mission!

<b>BMO</b>: [<i>frowning</i>] A mission?

<b>MO</b>: A special mission, like a vacation.

<b>BMO</b>: For all of us?

<b>MO</b>: No, no, no. A special solo mission.

[<i>Pause</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: For Neptr?

<b>MO</b>: [<i>chuckles</i>] No. It's a special rite of passage I designed just for you, BMO. A simple jaunt to the MO factory and back -- that's all -- and you'll be a grown-up.

<b>BMO</b>: Wow.

<b>Finn</b>: Hmm, I don't know. Sounds kind of dangerous.

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, BMO's like a baby almost.

<b>MO</b>: Oh, don't be silly. Every other MO has done it since forever.

<b>BMO</b>: But won't I miss Finn and Jake?

<b>MO</b>: Oh, sure. But don't worry. They'll be here when you get back.

<b>BMO</b>: But...won't Finn and Jake miss me?

<b>MO</b>: [<i>chuckles</i>] No, that's the beauty of it. I'll be BMO while you're gone. [<i>chuckling</i>]

<b>Neptr</b>: Hooray! Hooray!

<b>BMO</b>: Hooray?

<b>Neptr</b>: Hooray!

[<i>Cut to BMO walking far away from the Tree Fort on its way to <a href="/wiki/MO_Co." title="MO Co.">MO Co.</a> It stops when it sees rays of light come through the clouds.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: <a href="/wiki/Air" title="Air">Air</a>? Are you there, Air? It's me -- BMO. [<i>It sits down on a rock.</i>] I know it's been a long time since we talked. Sorry about that. But, well, maybe if you don't want to talk, you could just listen. Moe told me if I do this thing, I'll be a grown-up, and that sounds cool, I guess. [<i>Cut to fantasy sequence, where BMO, now taller and wearing a buttoned shirt and pants, drives a small car to the playground.</i>] Like, if I was grown, then I could drive to the playground all by myself. [<i>Cut to the store, where BMO is shopping.</i>] And I could buy my own pacifiers at the store, if I was grown. [<i>Cut to the Tree Fort door, which BMO is struggling to open.</i>] But then, if I change, will Finn and Jake still love me? [<i>Cut to Finn and Jake, whose faces are all mixed up.</i>] Will I still love them? [<i>Cut to Moe.</i>] Moe changed into a new body... [<i>Cut to robot "Moe".</i>] and he's still the same, I guess, sort of. [<i>Back to reality.</i>] But does growing up just change your body, or also your soul? [<i>sighs</i>] Maybe I could just stay the same forever.

[<i>Cut back to the Tree Fort.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: So...

<b>MO</b>: So!

<b>Finn</b>: Um... Yeah, it's nice to see you, Moe.

<b>MO</b>: Yeah, you too.

<b>Finn</b>: Uh... So, Moe, do you want to... uh... Jake?

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>hiding in a cup</i>] Oh, hey, I'm on my way. One sec.

<b>Finn</b>: Um, hold on, Moe. [<i>He walks over to the cup Jake is hiding in.</i>] Jake, what are you doing?

<b>Jake</b>: Finn, all this is heck of awkward without BMO -- way more awkward than I thought it'd be. I think maybe I don't like old people. They make me feel like I'm gonna get old one day, too. I'm just gonna stay in this cup for a bit. I'll be out later. [<i>He turns around.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>looking back at "Moe", who is waving</i>] You can't do that, it's rude. And what about Princess Bubblegum? She's way old, and you like her.

<b>Jake</b>: Yeah, but she listens to music. Moe probably only, like, listens to the sound of the earth decaying.

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>picking Jake out of the cup and putting him on his right shoulder</i>] Come on, you're being weird. [<i>He walks back to "Moe".</i>] Hey, sorry about that, Moe.

<b>MO</b>: Boys, I know this is new and different. I am not BMO. But I will do the best to be your friend. This is the daybreak of our lives, and we have all the time in the world to learn about each other. For now, I will be your little robot. [<i>He looks outside.</i>] Would you look at that beautiful snowfall. [<i>He turns back to Finn and Jake.</i>] Hey, let's get out there and have some fun.

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>whispering, to Finn</i>] I think I'm feeling better now.

[<i>Back to BMO, who has made its way to MO Co.</i>]

<b><a href="/wiki/DMO" title="DMO">DMO</a></b>: Oh, whoa! Hey! Hello there, BMO!

<b>BMO</b>: Hello there, DMO. I'm here on a solo birthday mission.

<b>DMO</b>: Oh, yes, yes, BMO, I know all about it. Moe left special instructions for you. [<i>chuckles</i>] He wants you to stand on that "X" over there.

<b>BMO</b>: Oh, okay. [<i>It walks over to a trapdoor with an "X" marked on it.</i>] Like this? [<i>It gasps, noticing loose wires hanging out of DMO's body.</i>] DMO, what happened to you?

<b>DMO</b>: Oh, this? It-it's nothing. It's just whatever.

<b>BMO</b>: Uh, I don't know about this, DMO. Something doesn't--

<b>DMO</b>: [<i>It pushes a button which opens the trapdoor.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: [<i>falling down a vent</i>] Aah! [<i>It lands on a series of saws and runs along over them.</i>] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! [<i>It falls through the edge and grabs a wire just before falling into a series of gears, but the wire unplugs and BMO swings on it like a vine.</i>] Whoa! [<i>It bounces off a wall, then grabs onto a ledge.</i>] Ugh! [<i>The ledge is really part of a crusher, which BMO lets go of and falls through a series of more crushers until one catches its foot.</i>] Hello?

[<i>Back at the snow outside the Tree Fort, where "Moe" is playing.</i>]

<b>MO</b>: [<i>chuckling</i>] Boys, look at this! This is cool, right?

[<i>Finn and Jake laugh as they use an office chair as a sleigh. They accidentally hit "Moe" on the head.</i>]

<b>MO</b>: Oh! [<i>screaming in pain</i>]

[<i>Finn and Jake go flying until they hit the ground and the chair breaks. They continue laughing.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Classic!

<b>Jake</b>: [<i>growing huge</i>] Yeah! Did you see what we did, Moe?

<b>MO</b>: [<i>sobs</i>] This is horseplay! Stop it! [<i>continues sobbing</i>] We need to go inside and do what I want to do!

<b>Finn</b>: Oh. O-okay. If -- if you want.

<b>MO</b>: [<i>still sobbing</i>] Yeah.

[<i>Cut back to the trash compactor, where BMO is still hanging on its leg in the crusher.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: Hello? DMO? Anybody? The "X" door opened, and I fell through. I think something went wrong with the mission. Uh... Abort mission! Unless...maybe this is all part of Moe's plan. [<i>Cut to BMO's fantasy sequence, where a boat with an umbrella branch is floating out at sea. BMO pops out of it.</i>] It doesn't seem like it. [<i>It climbs up on top of the umbrella.</i>] But maybe that's the point. [<i>It jumps off the boat and onto the top of the Tree Fort, which is mostly underwater.</i>] Maybe the lesson is that when you are grown, you won't ever be able to tell if everything is going totally haywire, or maybe actually everything is fine. [<i>Machinery whirring is heard.</i>] Huh?

[<i>Cut back to reality, where the crushers are opening, releasing BMO. It continues falling down and screaming until it lands in a pile of garbage.</i>]

<b>Robotic voice</b>: Huh? Who's there? Moe?

<b>BMO</b>: [<i>walking over to a talking garbage cube</i>] No. It's only me -- BMO.

<b>Garbage cube</b>: BMO? Oh, thank goodness. Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

<b>BMO</b>: Who are you? Are you a MO, too?

<b>Garbage cube</b>: Oh, BMO, no, no, no. I am <a href="/wiki/ALLMO" title="ALLMO">ALLMOs</a>.

<b>BMO</b>: ALLMOs? I don't understand.

<b>ALLMO</b>: Of course not. I'm so sorry. Let me explain.

[<i>Flashback to MO Co.</i>]

<b>ALLMO (VO)</b>: Peace had reigned in Moe's wondrous factory for a hundred hundred years. There was a place for every MO, and every MO was in its place. If you wanted a free hug, all you had to do was ask. No one could say no -- it was a rule. Until one fateful day -- yesterday -- when a mysterious viral signal somehow breached our firewall and was broadcast throughout the factory... instructing all us MOs to do somersaults into the trash compactor all day long.

<b>BMO (VO)</b>: That's horrible.

[<i>Back in the present day.</i>]

<b>ALLMO</b>: And we've been trapped here all smushed together, ever since.

<b>BMO</b>: That's horrible, too. How -- how do we get out?

<b>ALLMO</b>: Well, that's why we're so glad you're here, BMO. You're the key -- the key to escape. Only you can save us now.
