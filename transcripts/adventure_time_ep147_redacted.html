[<i><a href="/wiki/Cinnamon_Bun" title="Cinnamon Bun">Cinnamon Bun</a>, in a tuxedo, walks while carrying a tray of apple cider to Princess Bubblegum.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Cinnamon Bun, what the heck are you doing out in the woods?! I asked you twenty minutes ago to take these drinks around for us.

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Oh, oh, "<i>around for us</i>." I thought you said "<i>walk to the zoo and back</i>"!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: <i>Gob.</i> [<i>smacks forehead</i>]

[<i>Cinnamon Bun walks away and Princess Bubblegum sighs and follows him to Finn.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Finn, Cinnamon Bun's gonna attend your juice bar now. I have a special job for you.

[<i>Finn walks out.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: As Ooo's greatest champion, I'm relying on you to keep Lumpy Space Princess from crashing this wedding. I went ahead and deputized you. [<i>hands a badge to Finn</i>] So, you know, no holds barred, got it?

<b>Finn</b>: [<i>giggles</i>] Yeah. Oh, what about Jake?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Well, honestly I haven't seen Jake this happy in a while.

[<i>Jake is being tickled by 5 baby pigs.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I kinda don't want squash his groove.

[<i>Princess Bubblegum opens a door.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Knock, knock. Hey, Tree Trunks.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, hey, Princess. Wow, you look prettier than a sippy cup in a snowbank.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: [<i>giggles and closes the door behind her</i>] Thanks, Tree Trunks. Now listen, I don't want you to worry about a thing. I've got Finn on LSP Deputy, and we're keeping your ex-husbands, Randy, Danny and <a href="/wiki/Wyatt" title="Wyatt">Wyatt</a>, a hundred feet apart at all times - at least until it's time for me to perform the ceremony.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, well, uh, Princess, I appreciate your generosity going to all this trouble to hijack my wedding and all, but you can't perform the ceremony.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: <i>What?!</i> Why not?

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Uh, well, I'm sorry, but I just don't recognize your quote unquote "<i>authority</i>" on such matters. I can only be married by His Holiness, the One True King of Ooo.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: <b>WHAT?</b> <i>That</i> fraud?!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Now I know...

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: That <i>fraud</i> is here?!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Why, yes, but...

[<i>Princess Bubblegum leaves and slams the door.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, dear. Mama, I'm afraid I've offended the Princess.

<b>Tree Trunks' mother</b>: Oh, nonsense, baby. She's probably jealous 'cause you're about to marry a handsome, fine, saucy man. Oh, but he is a saucy, fine bologna factory. Mmmhmm, tell you what: I'd like to open up that hood, see how the bologna gets made!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Mama, please! Please don't call him a saucy fine bologna factory!

<b>Tree Trunks' mother</b>: Bologna factory, bologna factory, bologna factory!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, my perfect day. What else could go wrong?

[<i>Meanwhile, His Holiness, the King of Ooo, is outside with Mr. Pig's relatives.</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Please, go on. Describe the next thought form.

<b>Mr. Pig's relative</b>: Um... I see, like, reddish-green blotches.

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Ah... Ahaha! [<i>taps the relative with his wand</i>] One year good luck.

[<i>Mr. Pig's relatives are all amused. Meanwhile, Princess Bubblegum is hiding by a bush and is spying on the King of Ooo.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I've waited a long time for this King of Ooo, and now I'm gonna expose you in front of everyone for what you really are!

[<i>BMO laughs while spinning on the chair.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: Yay! [<i>giggles</i>]

<b>Wyatt</b>: Hey, uh, barkeep, can I have another one of these ciders?

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Sure! [<i>takes out the bottle of apple cider and tries to do a trick but has difficulty taking the cork out.</i>]

<b>Wyatt</b>: Hey, little robot. How ya doing?

<b>BMO</b>: I am the best! I love weddings, I love flowers! I love LOVE!

<b>Wyatt</b>: Hey, did you know I used to be married to Tree Trunks?

<b>BMO</b>: No!

<b>Wyatt</b>: Heh, yeah... it's just me and TT. We had some wild times back in the day. Did you know I once taught her to play tennis?

<b>BMO</b>: No...

<b>Wyatt</b>: Yep, tennis! I took her to one of those... uh... paddles... or whatever, you know!

<b>BMO</b>: No.

<b>Wyatt</b>: Yeah, she left me. She said I was stifling her spirit... I mean hehe... You know, what? Not enough tennis for ya?

<b>BMO</b>: No.

[<i>Mr Pig's relative runs and pushes another guest down.</i>]

<b>Mr. Pig's relative</b>: It's starting! The ceremony is starting! [<i>snorts</i>]

[<i>The scene moves to the wedding ceremony.</i>]

[<i>King of Ooo signals Jake to start playing music. Jake prepares to play his viola and his toe presses the play button of the radio.

<b>BMO</b>: [<i>gasp</i>] Oh no! I'm missing the love! [<i>gets off her stool</i>]

<b>Wyatt</b>: No! Uh, please stay here! This is cathartic. You're a good listener.

<b>BMO</b>: [<i>sadly</i>]Oh, okay... [<i>sits down again</i>]

[<i>Tree Trunks walk to Mr. Pig</i>]

<b>Mr Pig</b>: Psst, Sweetie, you look so nice.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Shh...

[<i>Finn is watching from afar.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Sounds really sweet.

[<i>Finn hears some rustling from the bushes and gets up.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Lumpy Space Princess? Is that you?

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: Let me go to this party...

[<i>A crow flies out, frightening Finn.</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: It's not your party, LSP. [<i>tries to find Lumpy Space Princess.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: Poor Finn. Don't you know? [<i>flies up from an old well. The wind blows the picnic mat off Lumpy Space Princess, revealing her in a wedding dress. After all, no wedding's complete without wedding crashers...</i>] <i>Every</i> party is <i>my</i> party.

[<i>Finn grunts and walks towards Lumpy Space Princess. Meanwhile, Jake is "playing" the viola, with the 5 baby pigs sleeping around his feet. The scene then moves on to Princess Bubblegum climbing a ladder to the King's blimp.</i>]

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I'm just gonna look in this guy's blimp. [<i>gets on the top of the ladder and turns the door knob</i>] Make sure everything's in accordance... [<i>breaks open the window with her shoe and opens the door</i>] with the laws.

<b>Mr. Pig</b>: Psst... sweetie, what are ya doing?

[<i>Tree Trunks is walking back, and far away are Finn and Lumpy Space Princess continuing their scuffle. Finn tries to block Lumpy Space Princess's way.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: Get out of my way, Finn. [<i>pushes Finn</i>] Oh my glob, you're touching my woman body!

[<i>Tree Trunks walks to the stage.</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Okay, dear, now up you come.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: [<i>whispers</i>] Don't hurry this. [<i>she slowly takes a step on the stage and King of Ooo lifts her up and brings her on stage.</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: There you go!

[<i>Mr Pig and Tree Trunks kiss for a while but King of Ooo push them back.</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Whoa, whoa, kids! Gotta finish the ceremony first. Keep the baby in the basket!

[<i>Lumpy Space Princess tries to get to the ceremony as Finn is pulling her by the dress.</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: Everyone at the party get ready! 'Cause here comes the hot bunch of grapes!

["Finn grunts and his foot meets a rock and flings her to a tent.<i>]</i>

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: Ahhhh... oh my gaaaah...

<b>King of Ooo</b>: We've gathered here on this beautiful day, under my life-giving sun, to celebrate the enjoinment of Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks, the little elephant. These two weird animals...

[<i>BMO is still watching from afar.</i>]

<b>BMO</b>: I bet some cute weddings are happening over there.

[<i>Cinnamon Bun still struggles to take the cork out.</i>]

<b>Wyatt</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] BMO, you're so nice.

<b>BMO</b>: Those flowers look really cold.

<b>Wyatt</b>: I've had a hard life. People <i>seem</i> cute. They <i>seem</i> nice. And then when you can't stop crying because they beat you in tennis that one time, they call you a baby.

<b>BMO</b>: Yeah, cute nice babies.

<b>Wyatt</b>: BMO?

<b>BMO</b>: Mm-hmm?

<b>Wyatt</b>: BMO, would you move in with me?

[<i>BMO gasps loudly as its eyes widen and runs into the forest.</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Do you, Mr Pig, take Tree Trunks to be your ever-wedded wife, forever following the teachings of me the true King of Ooo?

[<i>Cinnamon Bun is seen shaking the bottle of cider.</i>]

<b>Mr. Pig</b>: I do.

[<i>Princess Bubblegum grumbles, steers the blimp and pulls down a lever while stepping on the pedal.</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Do you, Tree Trunks, do you promise to love Mr. Pig forever, and spend the next 5 years with me and my serenity compound, performing simple household repairs, [<i>Mr. Pig puts the ring around Tree Trunk's paw</i>] to have and to hold the in sickness and in health, in my gated mountain compound?

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: I...

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: Everybody get ready... [<i> as she crawls to the ceremony, still with Finn pulling her</i>] to pay attention to me...

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: I...

[<i>Cinnamon Bun is still shaking the bottle of cider faster</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: do... oh [<i>looks over to Finn and Lumpy Space Princess right behind the guests, struggling to get closer. The blimp is also getting closer to the stage</i>]

<b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: Everybody, hey! I'm here! Look at my bouq- [<i>gets knocked by the blimp.</i>]

[<i>Princess Bubblegum gets off the blimp before it literally</i> crashes <i>the ceremony. Mr. Pig's mother is seen crying profusely and shaking her head. Cinnamon Bun shakes the bottle of cider and the cork is finally out.</i>]

<b>Cinnamon Bun</b>: Ah... [<i>pours the cider into Wyatt's glass.</i>]

<b>King of Ooo</b>: <i>My zep!</i>

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: Everybody! This wedding is a <i>farce!</i> A <i>criminal</i> farce!

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Hey, just what are you egging at here?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I'll tell you what I'm egging at! I'm egging at this outdated wedding officiant license!

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Oh, is that what this is about? You must've found that in my back records! I have the up-to-date paperwork right here!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh!

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: What? Uh...

<b>King of Ooo</b>: Hey, wait, how did you get that? I could've swore it was locked in my zep.

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: No... shhh... no... nope nope, stop talking, go to jail! [<i>handcuffs King of Ooo</i>] Yeah!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Princess Bubblegum, you have gone too far. We stand together against your tyranny.

[<i>Finn walks while grabbing a knocked out Lumpy Space Princess</i>]

<b>Finn</b>: Hey, everybody.

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Your prison may hold one of us, but it may not hold all of us.

[<i>All the guests are imprisoned. You and your</i> big <i>mouth, Tree Trunks.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, poor Tree Trunks. Wait, where's my mama? Has anyone seen my... oh!

[<i>Tree Trunk's mother and Wyatt are seen kissing.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: No, Mama. Well I guess this is it, sweetie. [<i>telepathic signals enter her head</i>] Oh, oh no, the elephant graveyard is calling me now. Okay, hold your horses, I'm coming!

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Oh, dear.

<b>Mr Pig</b>: Oh, my gosh. Tree Trunks, did you hear?

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Huh?

<b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I just can't stay mad at something so cute.

<b>Banana Guard</b>: Did she just say let everyone go?

[<i>Banana Guard Number 3 shrugs and the Banana Guard presses a button and the prison cell doors open and everyone including other criminals run out except for Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig.</i>]

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: Looks like we got the whole place to ourselves... if you know what I'm saying.

[<i>Princess Bubblegum cries while sipping her drink and watching them.</i>]

<b>Mr Pig</b>: Wait, d-don't you think there might be cameras down here?

<b>Tree Trunks</b>: I hope so...
